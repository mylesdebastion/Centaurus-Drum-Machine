# Persona Contexts for UX Review

Detailed persona profiles for embodying each user type during UX evaluation. Use these to internalize motivations, frustrations, and decision criteria.

## How to Use This File

When performing UX review:
1. **Read the full persona section** before analyzing screenshots
2. **Internalize their voice** - think and speak as they would
3. **Apply their lens** - judge UX through their goals and frustrations
4. **Use their bailout triggers** - identify what would make them quit

### Goals & Motivations

**Primary Goal:** Quick creative jamming with minimal setup

**What I want from Audiolux:**

### Frustrations & Bailout Triggers

**What makes me frustrated:**
- **Setup Hell**: "Just let me play!"
- **Technical Jargon**: MIDI? Audio buffer? Latency? USB-C vs Thunderbolt?
- **Too Many Steps**: More than 3 clicks is too many
- **Configuration Screens**: "Why do I need to configure anything?"
- **Assuming I Own Gear**: "I don't have a MIDI controller"

**I'd quit immediately if:**

- I see the word "configuration" or "settings"
- I'm asked about technical audio specs
