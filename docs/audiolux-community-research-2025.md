# Audiolux Target Communities Research - 2025

**Research Date:** January 2025
**Focus:** Finding ACTUAL online communities where Deaf/HOH musicians, visual music learners, and accessibility advocates actively gather

---

## Executive Summary

This research identifies the top 10 communities for Audiolux outreach based on engagement quality, member activity, and alignment with target audiences. Priority communities include D-PAN (59K+ Facebook followers), Drake Music's DMLab program (active maker community), AAMHL (musicians with hearing loss), and emerging TikTok ASL music creators with millions of followers.

**Key Finding:** The most engaged communities are NOT the largest organizations (NAD, HLAA) but rather specialized groups focused on music creation, ASL music content, and accessible instrument design.

## CONCLUSION

The most engaged communities for Audiolux outreach are **NOT the largest disability advocacy organizations**, but rather **specialized groups at the intersection of deaf culture, music creation, and accessible technology**.

Priority should be given to:
1. **D-PAN** (established ASL music community with media platform)
2. **Drake Music DMLab** (cutting-edge accessible instrument makers)
3. **TikTok/YouTube ASL music creators** (massive reach to young deaf audiences)
4. **AAMHL** (musicians actively seeking assistive technology solutions)

Success will depend on **authentic community engagement**, **disability justice principles**, and **delivering genuine value before asking for promotion**. Create content WITH the deaf community, not just FOR them.

**Key Insight:** Every outreach conversation should answer: "How does Audiolux amplify what deaf musicians are already doing, rather than 'fixing' what they supposedly can't do?"
