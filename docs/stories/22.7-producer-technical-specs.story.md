# Story 22.7: Add Technical Audio Specs to Producer Tutorial

**Epic**: 22 - AI-Native Product-Led Growth
**Status**: 📋 Draft
**Priority**: 🟠 High (UX Improvement)
**Estimated Effort**: 15 minutes
**Owner**: Solo Dev
**Source**: QA UX Review - Producer persona (78/100 CONCERNS)

## Story

As a **Producer evaluating platform audio quality**,
I want to **see technical audio specifications (latency, sample rate)**,
So that **I trust this is professional-grade, not compromised web audio**.

---

## Context

**Problem**: Producer tutorial (Story 22.1, `?v=p`) mentions MIDI support but doesn't mention audio quality specs. Producers care deeply about latency and sample rate - if there's 100ms latency or low-quality audio, the platform is unusable for production.

**QA Findings** (from `docs/qa/assessments/22.1-ux-p-20251025.md`):
- **Score**: 78/100 (CONCERNS gate)
- **Major Issue**: No technical audio specs (latency, sample rate) mentioned
- **Persona Voice**: *"MIDI support is great, but what about latency? What sample rate? Is this actually usable for production?"*

**Impact**: Producers question audio quality and may not trust platform for serious work.

**Solution**: Add brief technical spec callout to Step 2 (MIDI Support section).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must-Have

- [ ] **Technical Specs Mentioned in Step 2**:
  - Add audio quality specs to MIDI Support step
  - Mention low latency (specific ms if known, or "<10ms" range)
  - Mention sample rate (48kHz is professional standard)
  - Keep it brief (1 line callout, not paragraph)

- [ ] **Producer-Appropriate Language**:
  - Use technical terminology: "latency", "sample rate", "professional-grade"
  - Specific numbers (not vague "high quality")
  - Compare to professional standards (48kHz, <10ms latency)

- [ ] **Existing Tutorial Flow Intact**:
  - Tutorial still completes in 45 seconds
  - No additional steps added (just enhance Step 2 content)
  - Progress indicator and navigation unchanged

### Nice-to-Have

- [ ] Mention additional specs (bit depth, buffer size options)
- [ ] Link to technical documentation for more details
- [ ] Visual badge/icon indicating professional audio quality

---

## Existing System Integration

**Integrates with**:
- `src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/ProducerTutorial.tsx` (Story 22.1, Step 2)
- Existing MIDI Support step content

**Technology**:
- React functional components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Existing tutorial callout pattern

**Follows pattern**:
- Existing "Producer tip" callout format
- Existing technical info presentation style

**Touch points**:
- Producer tutorial Step 2 content (add callout after MIDI hardware list)
- No component changes required (copy edit only)

---

## Technical Notes

### Current Step 2 Content

**MIDI Support** step currently shows:
- Intro: "Connect your MIDI controllers directly to the browser - no drivers needed"
- Supported Hardware list (keyboards, pad controllers, LUMI keys)
- "Web MIDI API" callout

### Proposed Addition

**Add technical spec callout after hardware list:**

```markdown
🎚️ **Professional audio**: Low-latency engine (<10ms), 48kHz sample rate for studio-quality production
```

**OR (if actual specs known):**

```markdown
🎚️ **Professional audio**: <5ms latency, 48kHz/24-bit, adjustable buffer size (128-512 samples)
```

**Note**: Actual latency/specs should be verified from technical implementation before committing to specific numbers.

### Alternative: Simpler Version

If exact specs are unknown or variable:

```markdown
🎚️ **Professional-grade audio engine** with low latency and 48kHz sample rate
```

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Technical audio specs mentioned in Step 2 (latency + sample rate)
- [ ] Language is producer-appropriate (specific numbers, technical terms)
- [ ] Tutorial flow unchanged (no additional time added)
- [ ] Manual testing: Producer persona trusts audio quality
- [ ] QA re-review: Producer UX score improves (contributes to 78 → 90+ goal)

## QA References

- **Gate File**: `docs/qa/gates/22.1-ux-p.yml` (CONCERNS, 78/100)
- **Detailed Report**: `docs/qa/assessments/22.1-ux-p-20251025.md`
- **Screenshots**: `testing/persona-ux/screenshots/adhoc-p/adhoc-p-step2-desktop-20251025-1426.png`

**Major Issue Addressed**:
- ✅ Persona Friction: No technical audio specs mentioned

---

## Success Metrics

**Before** (from QA review):
- Step 2 mentions MIDI support but no audio quality specs
- Producer Voice: "But what about latency and sample rate?"

**Target After Fix**:
- Step 2 validates professional audio quality with specific specs
- Producer Voice: "Okay, <10ms latency and 48kHz - this is legit."
- Contributes to overall Producer UX score improvement (78 → 90+)

---

## Dev Notes

**TODO**: Verify actual audio specs from implementation:
- What is the actual latency? (Web Audio API typically <5-10ms)
- Sample rate: 48kHz or 44.1kHz?
- Is buffer size adjustable?
- Bit depth: 24-bit or 32-bit float?

Once verified, update callout with accurate numbers.

- [ ] Language uses technical terminology ("latency", "sample rate", "buffer size")
- [ ] Tutorial completes in 45 seconds (no time added)
- [ ] Producer persona voice: "Good, they understand pro audio requirements."
