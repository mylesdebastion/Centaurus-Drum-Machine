# Story 1.2: Web MIDI API Integration and Browser Compatibility

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** web application user,  
**I want** reliable MIDI device connection with proper browser compatibility detection,  
**so that** I can use hardware controllers when supported and receive clear guidance when not

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement Web MIDI API wrapper with automatic device detection
2. Create browser compatibility detection for Web MIDI API support
3. Implement graceful degradation messaging for Safari and unsupported browsers  
4. Build connection status indicators and error handling UI
5. Add HTTPS development setup documentation for Web MIDI requirements

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Application loads and functions normally on all browsers including Safari
- **IV2**: MIDI connection errors do not crash the application or lose sequencer state  
- **IV3**: Clear user messaging explains hardware requirements and limitations

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Web MIDI API Wrapper Implementation** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `src/hardware/utils/webMidiApi.ts` for Web MIDI API abstraction
  - [ ] Implement automatic MIDI device detection and enumeration

  - [ ] Create MIDI message parsing utilities for hardware communication
  
- [ ] **Task 2: Browser Compatibility Detection** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement Web MIDI API support detection in browser
  - [ ] Create compatibility matrix for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
  - [ ] Add user agent detection for specific browser messaging
  - [ ] Store compatibility results in localStorage for session persistence

- [ ] **Task 3: Graceful Degradation System** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create fallback messaging component for unsupported browsers
  - [ ] Implement Safari-specific guidance (Web MIDI not supported)
  - [ ] Design informational UI explaining hardware requirements
  - [ ] Add links to supported browser downloads and setup instructions

- [ ] **Task 4: Connection Status UI Components** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `HardwareStatusIndicator.tsx` showing real-time connection status
  - [ ] Integrate status indicator into existing Header component
  - [ ] Implement connection error display with user-friendly messages
  - [ ] Add device information display (name, connection state)

- [ ] **Task 5: Error Handling Integration** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Integrate MIDI errors with existing React error boundary system
  - [ ] Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [ ] Add error logging following existing console patterns
  - [ ] Ensure MIDI errors don't affect sequencer timing or audio engine

- [ ] **Task 6: HTTPS Development Documentation** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Document Web MIDI API HTTPS requirement in README
  - [ ] Provide local HTTPS development setup instructions
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common MIDI connection issues
  - [ ] Create browser-specific setup instructions

- [ ] **Task 7: Unit Testing** (AC: All)
  - [ ] Mock Web MIDI API for comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Test browser compatibility detection logic
  - [ ] Test graceful degradation across browser environments
  - [ ] Test connection error handling and recovery
  - [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage target

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1 Foundation**: Hardware abstraction layer established with HardwareManager context, React error boundaries, and event-driven communication system. This story builds Web MIDI API connectivity on top of that foundation.

### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
- **Browser Compatibility State**:
  - `webMidiSupported: boolean` - Browser Web MIDI API support status
  - `browserName: string` - Detected browser name for specific messaging
  - `requiresHttps: boolean` - Whether current context needs HTTPS for Web MIDI

- **Connection Status Extension to HardwareController**:
  - `connectionStatus` extends to include: `'unsupported' | 'requires_https'` states
  - `lastError: string | null` - Most recent connection error message
  - `reconnectAttempts: number` - Count of automatic reconnection attempts

### Component Specifications [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]
- **Web MIDI API Wrapper** (`src/hardware/utils/webMidiApi.ts`):
  - Abstracts browser Web MIDI API with consistent interface
  - Handles device enumeration and connection management
  - Provides error handling and retry logic
  - Integrates with HardwareManager event system

- **HardwareStatusIndicator** (`src/hardware/ui/HardwareStatusIndicator.tsx`):
  - Visual feedback for hardware connection status and device information
  - Composes into existing Header component through props
  - Follows Tailwind design patterns and Lucide React icons
  - Shows connection state, device info, error messages

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Web MIDI Utilities**: `src/hardware/utils/webMidiApi.ts`
- **Connection Management**: `src/hardware/utils/connectionManager.ts`
- **UI Components**: `src/hardware/ui/HardwareStatusIndicator.tsx`
- **Documentation Updates**: `README.md` with HTTPS setup instructions

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Web MIDI API**: Native Browser API only (no external libraries)
- **HTTPS Requirement**: Web MIDI API requires secure context (HTTPS or localhost)
- **Browser Support**: Chrome/Edge (full), Firefox (basic), Safari (not supported)
- **Error Isolation**: MIDI connection issues must not affect existing audio engine
- **Performance**: Connection status updates must not impact audio timing

### Browser Compatibility Matrix
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full Web MIDI API support with SysEx
- **Firefox**: Basic Web MIDI support (limited SysEx)
- **Safari**: No Web MIDI API support - graceful degradation required
- **Mobile Browsers**: Limited or no Web MIDI support

### Integration Guidelines
- **Error Boundary Integration**: Use existing React error boundary patterns from Story 1.1
- **State Management**: Extend HardwareManager context with browser compatibility state
- **UI Integration**: HardwareStatusIndicator integrates with existing Header component
- **Logging**: Follow existing console logging patterns with consistent formatting

### Testing
**Test Framework**: Jest/Vitest with React Testing Library [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]  
**Test Location**: `src/hardware/__tests__/webMidiApi.test.ts`, `src/hardware/__tests__/ui/`  
**Coverage Target**: 80% line coverage for all new modules  
**Testing Requirements**:
- Mock Web MIDI API across different browser scenarios
- Test browser compatibility detection accuracy
- Test graceful degradation UI rendering
- Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Cross-browser integration testing requirements documented

### Project Structure Notes
Builds on Story 1.1 hardware foundation with Web MIDI API specific utilities and UI components. Maintains complete isolation from existing drum machine code.
