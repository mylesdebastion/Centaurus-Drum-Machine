## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1-1.3**: HardwareStatusIndicator interface specified in architecture, ready for Header integration.

**Story 1.2**: HardwareStatusIndicator component partially specified for connection status display.

**Story 1.4**: LED feedback system requires user configuration controls (brightness, color modes, timing).

**Story 1.5**: Multi-device coordination requires device management interface for priority assignment and device roles.

### Data Models [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md & previous stories]
- **UI State Management**:
  - `hardwareUIPreferences: HardwareUISettings` - User preferences for hardware UI display
  - `deviceSettings: Map<string, DeviceSettings>` - Per-device configuration settings
  - `uiState: HardwareUIState` - Current UI state (open panels, active tabs, loading states)

- **Device Display Data**:
  - `deviceDisplayInfo: DeviceInfo[]` - UI-ready device information for display
  - `connectionStatusDisplay: ConnectionDisplay` - Visual connection status representation
  - `settingsPanelState: SettingsState` - Hardware settings panel state management

### Component Specifications [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]
- **HardwareStatusIndicator** (`src/hardware/ui/HardwareStatusIndicator.tsx`):
  - Visual feedback for hardware connection status and device information
  - Integrates into existing Header component through props
  - Uses existing Lucide React icons and Tailwind CSS patterns
  - Shows connection state, device info, error messages with onClick navigation

- **HardwareSettingsPanel** (`src/hardware/ui/HardwareSettingsPanel.tsx`):
  - Hardware configuration UI integrated into existing settings modal
  - APC40 LED brightness, color modes, button sensitivity controls
  - Multi-device management interface with priority assignment
  - Responsive behavior following existing Tailwind form patterns

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **UI Components**: `src/hardware/ui/`
  - `HardwareStatusIndicator.tsx` - Connection status display (Header integration)
  - `HardwareSettingsPanel.tsx` - Settings modal integration
  - `DeviceManager.tsx` - Multi-device management interface
- **Integration Points**: Existing Header component, existing settings modal

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **UI Framework**: React 18.2.0 functional components with hooks pattern
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.6 following existing design tokens and patterns
- **Icons**: Lucide React 0.294.0 for consistent icon system
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design with graceful hardware feature adaptation

### Integration Patterns
- **Header Integration**: HardwareStatusIndicator composes into existing Header via props
- **Settings Modal Extension**: Hardware settings panel extends existing modal architecture
- **State Management**: Uses existing React useState/Context patterns, localStorage persistence
- **Error Handling**: Integrates with existing error boundary system

### UI/UX Design Guidelines
- **Visual Consistency**: Follow existing Tailwind design tokens, spacing, colors
- **Component Patterns**: Use established component patterns from existing codebase
- **Mobile Strategy**: Hardware features gracefully degrade on mobile (focus on status, basic settings)
- **Accessibility First**: All hardware UI components keyboard accessible with ARIA labels

### Hardware UI Features
- **Connection Status**: Real-time visual indicators (connected, disconnected, error states)
- **Device Information**: Device names, types, capabilities, connection health
- **APC40 Settings**: LED brightness (0-100%), color modes (standard/high-contrast), sensitivity
- **Multi-Device Management**: Device list, priority assignment, role configuration
- **Error Display**: User-friendly hardware error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Responsive Design Strategy
- **Desktop**: Full hardware management interface with all controls
- **Tablet**: Optimized hardware settings with touch-friendly controls  
- **Mobile**: Essential status display, basic settings, hardware features noted as "desktop-optimized"
- **Graceful Degradation**: Hardware functionality noted but not prevented on mobile

### Integration Guidelines
- **No Existing UI Changes**: All hardware UI additions, zero modifications to existing components
- **Design Pattern Consistency**: Hardware components follow existing Tailwind patterns exactly
- **State Management**: Hardware UI state uses existing patterns, localStorage for persistence
- **Error Integration**: Hardware UI errors handled by existing error boundary system

### Testing
**Test Framework**: Jest/Vitest with React Testing Library [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]  
**Test Location**: `src/hardware/__tests__/ui/`  
**Coverage Target**: 80% line coverage for UI components  
**Testing Requirements**:
- React Testing Library for component rendering and interaction testing
- Accessibility testing with automated tools (axe-core) and manual testing
- Responsive design testing across viewport sizes
- Integration testing with existing Header and Settings components
- Multi-device UI scenario testing with device simulation
- User interaction testing (clicks, keyboard navigation, form submissions)

### Project Structure Notes
Hardware UI components integrate with existing application interface without modifications. Uses established React patterns, Tailwind design system, and accessibility standards. Complete hardware management experience while maintaining existing UI integrity.
