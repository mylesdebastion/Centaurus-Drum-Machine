# Story 8.3: Performance Optimization & Multi-Device Testing

**Epic:** Epic 8: Launchpad Pro Hardware Integration
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium
**Prerequisites:**
- ⏳ Story 8.2: Drum Sequencer Integration & Layout Orientation (MUST BE COMPLETE - Currently Draft)
- ⏳ Story 8.1: LaunchpadProController Implementation (Currently Approved, awaiting implementation)
- ✅ Story 8.0: Hardware Controller Selection Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

**Hardware Requirements:**
- **Recommended:** Physical Launchpad Pro Mk3 or 2015 hardware for AC4-AC5 verification
- **Fallback:** Console logging and protocol verification if hardware unavailable
- **Note:** ACs 4-5 marked "partially verified" if testing hardware-limited

---

## Story

**As a** developer ensuring hardware quality and performance,
**I want** LED updates to achieve 60fps smoothness with optimized batching and delta updates,
**so that** users experience fluid visual feedback without MIDI buffer overflow, and both Launchpad Pro models (Mk3/2015) work reliably alongside existing APC40 support.

---

## Background / Context

### Current State: ⚠️ Integration Complete, Performance Unoptimized

**What's Built (Stories 8.0, 8.1, 8.2):**
- ✅ LaunchpadProController with RGB LED control and button input
- ✅ Grid-to-sequencer integration (horizontal/vertical layouts)
- ✅ Color mapping utilities (spectrum/chromatic/harmonic)
- ✅ Basic LED update queue with 16 LED batching
- ✅ Velocity-sensitive brightness scaling

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ **No LED state caching** - Every LED update queued, even if color unchanged (wasteful)
- ❌ **Unoptimized batching** - Batch size/throttle interval not tuned for 60fps target
- ❌ **No performance metrics** - Cannot measure LED throughput or frame rate
- ❌ **Untested on hardware** - Protocol correctness unverified (Mk3 vs 2015 SysEx differences)
- ❌ **No multi-device testing** - APC40 regression risk, hot-swapping untested

### Performance Pain Points

1. **Potential MIDI Buffer Overflow:** Rapidly changing patterns may queue too many LED updates, causing browser freeze
2. **Redundant LED Updates:** Static steps re-update every frame (50%+ wasted MIDI messages)
3. **Unknown Throughput:** No benchmarks to verify 60fps target achievable
4. **Protocol Compatibility Unknown:** Mk3 (`0x0E`) vs 2015 (`0x10`) SysEx untested
5. **Regression Risk:** APC40 functionality may break due to shared HardwareManager code

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1: 60fps Visual Smoothness ✅

**Given** a full grid animation with rapidly changing pattern (all 64 LEDs)
**When** pattern plays for 10 seconds
**Then** LED updates achieve 60fps with no visible jitter or stuttering

- [ ] Test with worst-case: All 64 LEDs changing color every frame
- [ ] Performance maintained during rapid button input

**Alternative Verification (if hardware unavailable):**

### Critical Technical Details

#### LED State Cache Implementation
[Source: research/launchpad-pro-integration-findings.md#622-708]

**Cache Structure:**
```typescript
class LaunchpadProController {
  ledStates: Map<number, RGB> = new Map();

  setLED_RGB(note: number, color: RGB): void {
    // Delta update check
    const cached = this.ledStates.get(note);
    if (cached && cached.r === color.r && cached.g === color.g && cached.b === color.b) {
      return; // Skip redundant update
    }

    // Update cache and queue
    this.ledStates.set(note, color);
    this.queueLEDUpdate(note, color);
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces MIDI traffic by 50%+ (static steps don't re-update)
- Prevents MIDI buffer overflow during rapid pattern changes
- Improves overall system responsiveness

---

#### Performance Benchmarks
[Source: research/launchpad-pro-integration-findings.md#585-597]

**LED Update Methods Comparison:**

| Method | Message Size | Max Throughput | Use Case |
|--------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Note On (velocity palette) | 3 bytes | ~2000 LEDs/sec | Static patterns, simple colors |
| RGB SysEx (single LED) | 12 bytes | ~500 LEDs/sec | Custom colors, low update rate |
| **RGB SysEx (batch 16 LEDs)** | **68 bytes** | **~1200 LEDs/sec** | **Full grid updates (RECOMMENDED)** |

**60fps Target Calculation:**
- 60fps = 16.67ms per frame
- Full grid (64 LEDs) @ 60fps = 3840 LEDs/sec
- **Strategy:** Batched RGB SysEx (1200 LEDs/sec) + delta updates (skip static LEDs)
- **Result:** Achieves 60fps for typical sequencer patterns (20-40% of LEDs change per frame)

---

#### MIDI Latency Expectations
[Source: research/launchpad-pro-integration-findings.md#599-615]

**Button Input Latency:**
- Physical press → MIDI message: ~2-5ms
- MIDI message → JavaScript event: ~5-10ms
- **Total latency:** ~10-20ms (imperceptible to users)

**LED Update Latency:**
- JavaScript → MIDI send: ~1-2ms
- MIDI send → LED change: ~5-10ms
- **Total latency:** ~10-15ms (smooth visual feedback)

**Platform Differences:**
- Windows: 10-20ms MIDI latency
- macOS: 5-10ms (lower latency)
- Linux: 15-30ms (varies by ALSA/JACK config)

---

#### SysEx Protocol Differences (Mk3 vs 2015)
[Source: research/launchpad-pro-integration-findings.md#98-165]

**Primary Difference: Device ID byte**

**Mk3 Header:**
```
F0 00 20 29 02 0E [command] [data...] F7
                   ^^
                Device ID: 0x0E
```

**2015 Header:**
```
F0 00 20 29 02 10 [command] [data...] F7
                   ^^
                Device ID: 0x10
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
private get sysexHeader(): number[] {
  return this.modelVersion === 'mk3'
    ? [0xF0, 0x00, 0x20, 0x29, 0x02, 0x0E]
    : [0xF0, 0x00, 0x20, 0x29, 0x02, 0x10];
}
```

**Feature Differences:**
- Mk3: Polyphonic aftertouch (0xD0 messages)
- 2015: No aftertouch support
- Both: RGB LED control identical
- Both: Button input identical (Note On/Off)

### Testing

#### Testing Philosophy
[Source: CLAUDE.md#8-25]

This project uses **manual testing** with human-in-the-loop verification:
- Browser DevTools for performance metrics
- Visual inspection of LED smoothness (60fps target)
- Physical hardware testing with both Mk3 and 2015 (if available)
