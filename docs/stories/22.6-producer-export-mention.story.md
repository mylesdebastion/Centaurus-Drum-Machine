# Story 22.6: Add Export Capability Mention to Producer Tutorial

**Epic**: 22 - AI-Native Product-Led Growth
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Draft
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical (UX Blocker - Producer Bailout Trigger)
**Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes
**Owner**: Solo Dev
**Source**: QA UX Review - Producer persona (78/100 CONCERNS)

## Story

As a **Producer evaluating the platform via onboarding tutorial**,
I want to **know early that I can export MIDI/WAV stems**,
So that **I trust this is a professional tool, not a browser toy**.

---

## Context

**Problem**: Producer tutorial (Story 22.1, `?v=p`) never mentions export/download capabilities. Producers' #1 question when evaluating browser DAWs is "Can I export my work to finish in my desktop DAW?" Without this validation, producers assume the platform is toy-like and won't invest time.

**QA Findings** (from `docs/qa/assessments/22.1-ux-p-20251025.md`):
- **Score**: 78/100 (CONCERNS gate)
- **Critical Issue**: No export/download mention anywhere in tutorial
- **Producer Bailout Trigger**: "No export options" = assumes toy, not pro tool
- **Persona Voice**: *"Can I export MIDI/WAV? If not, this is useless to me. Why isn't export mentioned anywhere?"*

**Impact**: Producers will not trust platform for serious work, resulting in low conversion rate (current: 25% convert to Pro - highest of all personas, but requires trust).

**Solution**: Add export capability mention to tutorial (Step 1 module list OR Step 3 workflow).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must-Have

- [ ] **Export Mentioned in Tutorial**:
  - Add export capability to **either** Step 1 module list OR Step 3 workflow
  - Mention MIDI and WAV export (both formats important to producers)
  - Connect to desktop DAW workflow (Ableton, FL Studio, Logic)
  - Example text: "Export MIDI/WAV stems to continue in your desktop DAW"

- [ ] **Producer-Appropriate Language**:
  - Use professional terminology: "stems", "export", "desktop DAW integration"
  - No dumbing down: "download your track" â†’ "export MIDI/WAV stems"
  - Emphasize workflow portability (create in browser, finish in desktop DAW)

- [ ] **Existing Tutorial Flow Intact**:
  - Tutorial still completes in 45 seconds
  - No additional steps added (just enhance existing content)
  - Progress indicator and navigation unchanged

### Nice-to-Have

- [ ] Export mentioned in BOTH Step 1 and Step 3 (reinforce trust)
- [ ] Visual export icon/badge next to export mention
- [ ] Specific export formats listed (MIDI, WAV, stems)

---

## Existing System Integration

**Integrates with**:
- `src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/ProducerTutorial.tsx` (Story 22.1)
- Existing tutorial step content

**Technology**:
- React functional components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Existing tutorial step structure

**Follows pattern**:
- Existing tutorial content format (text + callouts)
- Existing module list pattern (Step 1)
- Existing workflow list pattern (Step 3)

**Touch points**:
- Producer tutorial steps array (modify Step 1 OR Step 3 content)
- No component changes required (copy edit only)

---

## Technical Notes

### Option 1: Add to Step 1 Module List (Recommended)

**Current Step 1** shows available modules:
- Drum Machine
- Melody Sequencer
- Chord Arranger
- Piano Roll
- Sample Pad
- Instrument Rack

**Proposed Addition**:
Add to module list:
- **Export Engine** - Download MIDI/WAV stems to continue in desktop DAW

**Pros**: Early validation (Step 1), shows export as core feature
**Cons**: Adds 7th module to list (slightly longer)

### Option 2: Add to Step 3 Workflow

**Current Step 3** shows production workflow:
1. Start with Drum Machine to lay down a beat
2. Add chords using Chord Arranger
3. Layer melody with Melody Sequencer
4. Refine with Piano Roll (MIDI input)
5. Adjust global tempo/key in Music Header

**Proposed Addition**:
Add 6th step:
6. **Export MIDI/WAV stems** to finish in Ableton/FL Studio/Logic

**Pros**: Natural workflow progression, shows export as final step
**Cons**: Later in tutorial (less early validation)

### Option 3: Both (Best)

Add to **both** Step 1 (module list) and Step 3 (workflow) for maximum trust-building.

**Recommendation**: **Option 3 (both)** - producers need early validation AND workflow context.

## Copy Recommendations

### Step 1 Addition

**After current module list, add:**

```markdown
**ðŸ”§ Export Engine**
Download MIDI/WAV stems to continue in your desktop DAW (Ableton, FL Studio, Logic)
```

### Step 3 Addition

**Add as 6th workflow step:**

```markdown
6. **Export stems** - Download MIDI/WAV to finish in your desktop DAW
```

### Alternative Callout (If preferred)

**Add callout box after workflow:**

```markdown
ðŸ’¡ **Producer tip**: Export your work at any time to continue in external DAW. MIDI and WAV stems supported.
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Export capability mentioned in Producer tutorial (Step 1 OR Step 3, preferably both)
- [ ] Language is producer-appropriate (stems, MIDI/WAV, desktop DAW)
- [ ] Tutorial flow unchanged (no additional time added)
- [ ] Manual testing: Producer persona immediately understands export is available
- [ ] QA re-review: Producer UX score improves from 78 to 90+ (PASS gate)

- **Detailed Report**: `docs/qa/assessments/22.1-ux-p-20251025.md`
- **Screenshots**: `testing/persona-ux/screenshots/adhoc-p/`

**Critical Issue Addressed**:

---

## Success Metrics

**Before** (from QA review):
- UX Score: 78/100
- Gate: CONCERNS
- Persona Friction: CONCERNS (71/100)
- Producer assumes platform is toy-like without export validation

**Target After Fix**:
- UX Score: 90+ (PASS gate)
- Persona Friction: PASS (85+)
- Producer trusts platform for serious work
- Increased Pro tier conversion (25% â†’ 30%+ potential)
