# Story 14.1: Brownfield Module System Architecture Design

## Status
COMPLETE

## Story
**As a** system architect,
**I want** comprehensive architecture documentation for the module system refactoring,
**so that** developers can implement the module adapter pattern with clear guidance on global/local control separation, context detection, and integration with Epic 4 infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete brownfield architecture document using `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml` template
2. Module inventory & control analysis covering all 5 modules (PianoRoll, GuitarFretboard, IsometricSequencer, DrumMachine, LiveAudioVisualizer)
3. Control classification with rationale (global vs. local vs. TBD)
4. Module adapter pattern design with TypeScript interfaces
5. Integration strategy phasing (Phase 1-3 with module priorities)
6. Migration plan preserving standalone view functionality (no breaking changes)
7. Coordination with Epic 13 documentation consolidation (reconciliation audit integration)

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Architecture document passes Winston (Architect) review using elicitation methods
- **IV2**: All 12 sections complete (Introduction through Next Steps)
- **IV3**: Module adapter pattern validated against existing Epic 4 patterns (GlobalMusicContext, always-mount)
- **IV4**: TBD questions (LED routing, hardware sharing, chord sync) clearly marked for Product Owner research

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context

**Epic 4 Foundation (Complete):**
- GlobalMusicContext: `src/contexts/GlobalMusicContext.tsx` (Story 4.1)
- GlobalMusicHeader: `src/components/GlobalMusicHeader/GlobalMusicHeader.tsx` (Story 4.2)
- Module loading system: `src/components/Studio/` (Story 4.7)
- Always-mount pattern: Proven in JamSession (CSS visibility, no unmount/remount)

**Epic 13 Coordination (In Progress):**
- Documentation consolidation: Epics 1-4 moving from `docs/prd/` to `docs/epics/`
- Architecture updates: 12 components need source-tree.md documentation
- This epic will add module adapter patterns to component-architecture.md

**Module Analysis Findings:**
- 3 modules need full refactoring (PianoRoll, GuitarFretboard, IsometricSequencer)
- 1 module partially integrated (DrumMachine - uses global tempo/colorMode)
- 1 module optional (LiveAudioVisualizer - global volume integration)
- Duplicate controls: Key/Scale (3x), Tempo (2x), Color Mode (2x)

### Brownfield Architecture Template

**Template:** `.bmad-core/templates/brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml`

**Required Sections:**
1. ✅ Introduction (Existing Project Analysis, Constraints, Module Inventory)
2. ✅ Enhancement Scope & Integration Strategy (Code/UI/DB/API integration, Compatibility)
3. ✅ Tech Stack (Existing + New - zero new dependencies)
4. ✅ Data Models & Schema Changes (TypeScript interfaces, transport state, migration path)
5. ✅ Component Architecture (useModuleContext hook, GlobalMusicContext extension, module patterns, Mermaid diagram, developer checklist)
6. ✅ API Design (N/A backend, Web APIs documented)
7. ✅ Source Tree (New files, modified files, file size summary)
8. ✅ Infrastructure & Deployment (No changes, bundle size impact)
9. ✅ Coding Standards (Patterns for context detection, graceful degradation, conditional rendering)
10. ✅ Manual Verification Strategy (Browser-based testing workflows adapted for small-scale project)
11. ✅ Security Integration (No changes, existing patterns maintained)
12. ✅ Next Steps (Story Manager + Developer handoff prompts, phased implementation plan, TBD questions)

### Session Progress Tracking

**Sections Complete:** 12 of 12 (100%)
**Architecture Document Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Version 1.0)
**Final Document Size:** ~4900 lines
**User Preference:** "proceed" command (efficient workflow)

### Design Decisions Log

**Global Transport Control (Design Principle #1):**
- Pattern: DAW/MTC-style master transport
- Global play/pause affects all sequencer/instrument modules
- Visualizers continue running (always-on for live audio)
- Modules retain individual play/pause for performance flexibility
- Rationale: Industry standard (Ableton, Logic, FL Studio), DAWLESS hardware MIDI MTC

**Standalone View Preservation (Design Principle #2):**
- Pattern: Context detection with graceful degradation
- Modules function standalone with local state fallback
- When embedded: Consume GlobalMusicContext, hide redundant controls
- No breaking changes to existing routes
- Rationale: Users share direct links (e.g., `/piano` for education demos)

**Always-Mount Pattern (Design Principle #3):**
- Pattern: CSS visibility control (JamSession proven approach)
- All modules rendered, CSS controls visibility
- Audio contexts persist, no pops/clicks from re-initialization
- Rationale: Professional DAW behavior, maintains visualizations

**Documentation Alignment (Design Principle #4):**
- Architecture tracks Epic 13 consolidation
- Epic/story numbers may shift during reconciliation
- Architecture supports greenfield documentation structure
- Rationale: Prevents architecture/documentation drift

**Module Adapter Pattern (Code Integration):**
- Pattern: `useModuleContext()` hook via React Router `useLocation`
- No prop drilling, context detection internal to modules
- Graceful degradation: `const key = context === 'standalone' ? localKey : globalMusic.key`
- Rationale: Simplicity, TypeScript support, no HOC complexity

**Transport State Storage:**
- Pattern: In-memory only (GlobalMusicContext), NOT persisted to localStorage
- Prevents confusing "auto-play on reload" behavior
- Rationale: User expectations (DAWs don't auto-play on open)

**TBD Deferred to Product Owner:**
- LED routing strategy (per-module vs. global routing table)
- Hardware sharing (MIDI/WLED device arbitration)
- Chord progression system (global mode vs. module content)
- Transport edge cases (visualizer stop behavior, module-level override)
- Rationale: Complex user research questions, avoid premature optimization
