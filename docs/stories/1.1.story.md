# Story 1.1: Hardware Abstraction Layer Foundation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system architect,  
**I want** a modular hardware abstraction layer,  
**so that** multiple MIDI controllers can interface with the core sequencer without tight coupling

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create `src/hardware/core/` module with standardized controller interfaces  
2. Implement event-driven communication system for hardware ↔ sequencer interaction
3. Design controller lifecycle management (connect/disconnect/error handling)  
4. Establish plugin architecture for future hardware module additions
5. Create TypeScript interfaces defining hardware module contracts

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Existing sequencer functionality remains completely unchanged and operational
- **IV2**: Core sequencer operates normally when no hardware modules are connected  
- **IV3**: Performance benchmarks show <5% overhead from abstraction layer

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Create Core Hardware Directory Structure** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `src/hardware/core/` directory following project structure guidelines
  - [ ] Create `src/hardware/core/types.ts` with TypeScript interfaces
  - [ ] Create barrel export `src/hardware/index.ts` following existing patterns
  - [ ] Add hardware types to main `src/types/index.ts` file

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement HardwareController Interface** (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Define `HardwareController` base interface with lifecycle methods
  - [ ] Define `ControllerCapabilities` interface for feature detection
  - [ ] Define `HardwareEvent` interface for event communication
  - [ ] Implement TypeScript strict mode compliance as per existing standards

- [ ] **Task 3: Create HardwareManager Component** (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Implement `HardwareManager.tsx` as React Context provider
  - [ ] Implement `useHardware.ts` custom hook for hardware access
  - [ ] Create controller registration/deregistration system
  - [ ] Add lifecycle management (connect/disconnect/error handling)

- [ ] **Task 4: Build Event System** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement event-driven communication using React patterns
  - [ ] Create hardware ↔ sequencer state synchronization
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring for <5% overhead requirement
  - [ ] Integrate with existing Tone.js timing system

- [ ] **Task 5: Error Boundary Protection** (Integration requirements)
  - [ ] Wrap hardware components in React error boundaries
  - [ ] Ensure hardware errors don't crash main application
  - [ ] Implement graceful degradation when hardware unavailable
  - [ ] Follow existing logging patterns for error reporting

- [ ] **Task 6: Unit Testing** (AC: All)
  - [ ] Create `src/hardware/__tests__/` directory
  - [ ] Test HardwareController interface implementations
  - [ ] Test HardwareManager lifecycle and event system
  - [ ] Mock Web MIDI API for testing as per testing strategy
  - [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage target

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
*This is the first story in the epic - no previous implementation context.*

### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
- **HardwareController Interface**:
  - `id: string` - Unique identifier for controller instance
  - `name: string` - Human-readable controller name  
  - `connectionStatus: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'error'` - Real-time connection state
  - `capabilities: ControllerCapabilities` - Features supported by this controller

- **HardwareEvent Interface**:
  - `type: 'step_toggle' | 'connection_change' | 'hardware_input'` - Event classification
  - `controllerId: string` - Source controller identifier
  - `data: Record<string, unknown>` - Type-safe event payload
  - `timestamp: number` - High-precision event timing

- **State Management**: All hardware state managed in React component state and localStorage, no database changes required

### Component Specifications [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]
- **HardwareManager**:
  - Central orchestrator for all hardware controller lifecycle management
  - React context provider wrapping existing App component
  - Key interfaces: `useHardware()` hook, `registerController()`, `broadcastSequencerState()`
  - Technology: React Context API, TypeScript interfaces, Web MIDI API integration

- **Integration Points**: 
  - Subscribes to existing sequencer context/state without modifying existing components
  - Complete isolation from existing DrumMachine components
  - Uses existing React patterns and event handling

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Core Hardware Module**: `src/hardware/core/`
  - `HardwareManager.tsx` - Central hardware orchestrator
  - `useHardware.ts` - React hook for hardware access  
  - `types.ts` - Hardware TypeScript interfaces
- **Barrel Export**: `src/hardware/index.ts` following existing import/export patterns
- **Type Integration**: Extend existing `src/types/index.ts` with hardware interfaces

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.2.2 with strict mode compliance
- **Framework**: React 18.2.0 functional components with hooks pattern
- **No External Dependencies**: Use only browser-native APIs and existing project dependencies
- **Performance**: Abstraction layer must add <5% overhead to existing system

### Testing
**Test Framework**: Jest/Vitest with React Testing Library (extending existing configuration) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]  
**Test Location**: `src/hardware/__tests__/` directory structure  
**Coverage Target**: 80% line coverage for all hardware modules  
**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for HardwareController interface implementations
- Integration tests for hardware ↔ sequencer state synchronization  
- Mock Web MIDI API for testing environment
- Automated regression tests to verify existing sequencer functionality unchanged

### Project Structure Notes
Perfect alignment with unified project structure - hardware module is completely self-contained in `src/hardware/` preventing any coupling with existing code.
