# Story: 3D Lane Integration with Official Boomwhacker Colors

## Story ID: EPIC-2-VIS-002
**Status:** Draft
**Epic:** Epic 2 - 3D Boomwhacker Music Learning Application
**Priority:** High

## Story
As a music educator using the 3D boomwhacker sequencer, I want the lane labels to be integrated into the 3D scene with official boomwhacker colors for the complete chromatic scale, so that students can immediately recognize the standard color-to-note associations and have an immersive 3D learning experience without disconnected 2D overlays.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lane labels are rendered as 3D text within the 3D coordinate system (not HTML overlays)
- [ ] Complete 12-note chromatic scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B)
- [ ] Official Boomwhacker color mapping for all 12 chromatic notes
- [ ] Lane dividers use corresponding note colors instead of generic cyan
- [ ] 3D labels maintain readable orientation and scale with perspective
- [ ] Labels positioned at lane entrances in 3D space for clear association
- [ ] Color-coded lane system enhances educational value and visual hierarchy
- [ ] Labels integrate with 3D lighting and glow effects
- [ ] Smooth transition from current 8-lane to 12-lane chromatic system
- [ ] Note frequencies updated to match complete chromatic scale

## Dev Notes
- Reference official Boomwhacker color standard from PRD section 6.1
- Current system uses 8 lanes with custom neon colors (incorrect)
- Need to expand world layout calculations for 12 lanes
- Camera positioning may need adjustment for wider lane arrangement
- 2D HTML overlays break 3D immersion and educational consistency

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement official Boomwhacker color system
  - [ ] Replace neon color array with official chromatic colors
  - [ ] Update color mapping: C=#ff4444, C#=#ff8844, D=#ffaa44, etc.
  - [ ] Ensure colors meet accessibility contrast requirements
  - [ ] Test color visibility against night theme background
- [ ] Expand to 12-lane chromatic system
  - [ ] Update lanes constant from 8 to 12
  - [ ] Recalculate world layout for additional lanes
  - [ ] Adjust camera positioning for wider view
  - [ ] Update note frequency array for complete chromatic scale
- [ ] Implement 3D lane labels
  - [ ] Remove 2D HTML overlay lane labels
  - [ ] Create 3D text rendering system
  - [ ] Position labels at lane entrances in 3D space
  - [ ] Ensure labels scale properly with perspective
  - [ ] Maintain readable orientation regardless of camera angle
- [ ] Color-code lane dividers
  - [ ] Replace uniform cyan dividers with note-specific colors
  - [ ] Implement gradient transitions between adjacent lanes
  - [ ] Add color-specific glow effects for enhanced visibility
  - [ ] Ensure divider colors complement note colors
- [ ] Update educational features
  - [ ] Verify note names match chromatic positions
  - [ ] Update audio frequencies for expanded scale
  - [ ] Test color-note recognition with music educators
  - [ ] Ensure smooth learning curve from 8 to 12 notes

## Testing
- Visual regression tests for color accuracy
- Educational effectiveness testing with music teachers
- Accessibility testing for color-blind users
- Performance testing with expanded 12-lane system
- Cross-browser color rendering verification

## File List
- `src/components/IsometricSequencer/IsometricSequencer.tsx` (primary changes)

## Change Log
- Initial story creation for 3D lane integration and official color system
- Focus on educational standards compliance and 3D immersion
