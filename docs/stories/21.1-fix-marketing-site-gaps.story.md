**Status**: üìã Draft
**Priority**: üî¥ Critical (Week 1)
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Owner**: Solo Dev

---

## Story

As a **potential user visiting www.audiolux.app**,
I want **clear answers to my questions and a working demo video**,
So that **I can understand what Audiolux does and see it in action before signing up**.

---

## Context

**Problem**: Marketing site assessment revealed critical gaps that block user conversion:
1. **FAQ section has questions but NO ANSWERS** (major UX failure)
2. **Demo video link exists but is NON-FUNCTIONAL**
3. **Only 3 testimonials** (need 5+ for social proof)
4. **No competitor comparison table** (users can't understand differentiation)
5. **Limited visual assets** (only 1 screenshot of the Studio)

**Impact**: High bounce rate, low trust, poor conversion to sign-ups

**Source**: Marketing site assessment (WebFetch analysis, 2025-10-25)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Demo Video Quality
**Risk**: First attempt at video may be choppy, unclear, or too long
**Mitigation**: Record 2-3 takes, use script, test on others before publishing

### Risk 2: Time Overrun
**Risk**: Creating video + screenshots + content may take longer than estimated
**Mitigation**: Prioritize FAQ answers and demo video (must-have), defer screenshots to Story 21.3 if needed

### Risk 3: Competitor Table Perceived as Unfair
**Risk**: Comparison table could be seen as biased
**Mitigation**: Be objective, cite sources, focus on factual differences (not subjective claims)
