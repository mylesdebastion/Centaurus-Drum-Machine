# Story: Upgrade Vite to Fix Development Server Security Vulnerability

## Story ID: MAINT-SEC-001
**Status:** Pending
**Epic:** Infrastructure & Security
**Priority:** Medium
**Type:** Security Maintenance

## Story
As a developer working on the Centaurus Drum Machine, I want to upgrade Vite from 5.0.8 to 7.x to address a moderate security vulnerability in the development server, so that the local development environment is protected from potential attacks.

## Security Context
**CVE:** GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
**Severity:** Moderate
**Impact:** Development environment only (production builds unaffected)
**Attack Vector:** Malicious website sending requests to local dev server and reading responses
**Risk Level:** Low (requires visiting malicious site while dev server is running on localhost)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vite upgraded from 5.0.8 → 7.1.9+
- [ ] esbuild vulnerability resolved (requires >=0.24.3)
- [ ] All npm dependencies installed without errors
- [ ] Development server starts successfully (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Production build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] No breaking changes affecting existing functionality
- [ ] `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities

## Dev Notes
**Current State:**
- Vite 5.0.8 installed
- esbuild <=0.24.2 (vulnerable version)
- 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities detected
- No production impact (dev server only)

**Upgrade Path:**
- Vite 5.0.8 → 7.1.9 (breaking change)
- esbuild automatically updated as dependency
- Review Vite 6.x and 7.x migration guides
- Test for breaking changes in build config

## Tasks
- [ ] Review Vite 6.x and 7.x migration guides
  - [ ] Check breaking changes documentation
  - [ ] Review vite.config.ts compatibility
  - [ ] Note any plugin API changes
- [ ] Backup current configuration
  - [ ] Document current vite.config.ts settings
  - [ ] Note any custom build configurations
- [ ] Perform upgrade
  - [ ] Run `npm audit fix --force`
  - [ ] Review package.json changes
  - [ ] Install updated dependencies
- [ ] Test development environment
  - [ ] Start dev server (`npm run dev`)
  - [ ] Verify hot module replacement (HMR)
  - [ ] Test MIDI device connectivity
  - [ ] Check all routes load correctly
- [ ] Test production build
  - [ ] Run `npm run build`
  - [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation
  - [ ] Check bundle output in dist/
  - [ ] Test built application (`npm run preview`)
- [ ] Run test suite
  - [ ] Execute `npm test`
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass
  - [ ] Check test coverage maintained
- [ ] Verify security fix
  - [ ] Run `npm audit` to confirm 0 vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Document resolution in changelog

## Breaking Changes to Watch For
- Vite 6.x:
  - Node.js version requirements
  - Environment variable handling changes
  - Plugin API updates
- Vite 7.x:
  - Build target defaults
  - CSS handling changes
  - React plugin compatibility

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Dev server starts without errors
- [ ] HMR works correctly during development
- [ ] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] All routes accessible in built app
- [ ] MIDI functionality unchanged
- [ ] Audio playback works correctly
- [ ] Isometric sequencer renders properly
- [ ] No console errors in development
- [ ] No console errors in production build

## Rollback Plan
If breaking changes cannot be resolved:
1. Revert package.json to previous versions
2. Run `npm install` to restore previous state
3. Document specific blockers
4. Consider alternative vulnerability mitigation:
   - Only run dev server on localhost (already default)
   - Avoid visiting untrusted websites while dev server runs
   - Schedule upgrade for future milestone

## File List
- `package.json` (version updates)
- `package-lock.json` (dependency tree)
- `vite.config.ts` (potential config changes)
- `.nvmrc` or `package.json` engines field (Node version requirements)

## Dependencies
- Vite 7.1.9+ (breaking change from 5.0.8)
- Compatible esbuild version (>=0.24.3)
- Node.js version compatible with Vite 7.x

## Timeline
**Not Urgent** - Can be scheduled during:
- Next maintenance window
- Between feature development cycles
- Before exposing dev server beyond localhost

**Recommended:** Complete within 1-2 sprints
