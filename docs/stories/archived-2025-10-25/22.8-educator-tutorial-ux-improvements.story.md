# Story 22.8: Educator Tutorial UX Improvements

**Epic**: 22 - AI-Native Product-Led Growth Flywheel
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Ready for Dev
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical (blocks Educator conversion)
**Estimated Effort**: 10 hours
**Owner**: Solo Dev

**QA Review**: `docs/qa/assessments/22.1-ux-educator-20251025.md`
**Gate**: CONCERNS (68/100) - 3 critical issues, 50% bailout risk

---

## Story

As an **educator evaluating Audiolux for my classroom**,
I want **to see visual learning and accessibility features in action during the tutorial**,
So that **I'm confident this tool works for my diverse students and can request budget approval**.

---

## Context

**Problem**: QA review of Educator persona tutorial (e) identified 3 critical UX issues causing 50% bailout risk:

1. **No Visual Learning Demo** - Tutorial *describes* Chord Arranger but never *shows* color-coded notes
2. **Missing Accessibility Features** - Mentioned "Deaf/HOH students" but never demonstrated visual feedback
3. **No Pricing Information** - Educators need pricing ($199/yr classroom license) for budget approval

**Impact**:
- Educators abandon at completion (50% bailout risk)
- Promise broken: "Teach music visually" never shown
- Can't request budget approval without pricing
- Inclusive education claim unproven

**Solution**: Transform Educator tutorial from "tell" to "show":
- Add interactive Chord Arranger demo (see visual learning in action)
- Add Accessibility Tour step (prove inclusive education claim)
- Add pricing to completion screen (enable budget approval)

**Psychology**: Educators need proof before committing classroom time. Show, don't tell.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must-Have

#### 1. Interactive Visual Learning Demo (Step 2)

- [ ] **Replace text-only Step 2 with interactive Chord Arranger preview**:
  - Load Chord Arranger component automatically
  - Show "Try clicking 'C Major' below â†’" instruction
  - Educator clicks button â†’ color-coded notes appear (C=red, E=yellow, G=blue)
  - Show "Try 'G Major' next â†’" instruction
  - Educator clicks â†’ different color pattern appears
  - Display "This is visual music theory in action!"
  - Auto-advance to Step 3 after second click

- [ ] **Visual feedback requirements**:
  - Color-coded notes clearly visible (minimum 3 colors)
  - Notes animate on appearance (fade-in or scale-up)
  - Chord label displayed ("C Major", "G Major")
  - Loading state while Chord Arranger initializes

- [ ] **Interaction constraints**:
  - Only 2 chords required (C Major, G Major)
  - No ability to skip (must click both)
  - Progress indicator: "Step 2 of 5" (updated from "2 of 4")
  - Time target: 20 seconds total

**Persona Voice**: "SHOW me the color-coded notes! Let me click and SEE visual feedback!"

**Refs**:
- Component: `src/components/ChordArranger/ChordArranger.tsx`
- Tutorial: `src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/EducatorTutorial.tsx`
- QA Issue: `docs/qa/gates/22.1-ux-educator.yml:23-36`

---

#### 2. Accessibility Tour (New Step 4)

- [ ] **Add new Step 4: "Inclusive for All Learners"**:
  - Show frequency visualizer running (live audio visualization)
  - Show visual waveform display
  - Display color-coded notes example
  - List accessibility features:
    - "Color-coded notes (tone recognition)"
    - "Visual waveforms (rhythm and volume)"
    - "Frequency visualizer (pitch and harmony)"
  - State explicitly: "Perfect for Deaf, hard-of-hearing, and visual learners"
  - Green "Next: Get Started â†’" button

- [ ] **Visual requirements**:
  - Frequency visualizer shows live animation (bars moving)
  - Waveform shows audio pattern (sine wave or similar)
  - Color-coded notes use same colors as Chord Arranger (consistency)
  - All visuals clearly visible on both light and dark backgrounds

- [ ] **Accessibility compliance**:
  - Alt text for all visualizations
  - ARIA labels for screen readers
  - Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

**Persona Voice**: "WHERE are the visual features for my Deaf students? SHOW me they work!"

- Visualizer: `src/components/FrequencyVisualizer/FrequencyVisualizer.tsx`
- Tutorial: `src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/EducatorTutorial.tsx`
- QA Issue: `docs/qa/gates/22.1-ux-educator.yml:38-51`

---

#### 3. Pricing Information (Completion Screen)

- [ ] **Add pricing section to completion screen**:
  - Display header: "ðŸŽ“ Classroom License: $199/year"
  - List benefits:
    - "30 students + 1 teacher"
    - "All features included"
    - "30-day free trial (no credit card required)"
  - Two CTAs:
    - Primary: "Start Free Trial" (purple, opens trial signup)
    - Secondary: "Explore Studio First" (green, opens studio)

- [ ] **Pricing display requirements**:
  - Price prominent (24px font, bold)
  - Benefits bulleted and clear
  - Trial messaging removes risk ("no credit card")
  - CTAs properly sized (48px height minimum for touch)

- [ ] **Optional: Add pricing tiers**:
  - Classroom: $199/yr (30 students)
  - School: $499/yr (100 students)
  - District: $999/yr (500 students)
  - Show as collapsible section: "View all pricing â†’"

**Persona Voice**: "HOW MUCH? I need this number to request budget approval!"

**Refs**:
- Completion: `src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/EducatorTutorial.tsx`
- Pricing: `docs/personas/e-educator.md:131-135`
- QA Issue: `docs/qa/gates/22.1-ux-educator.yml:53-66`

---

### Should-Have

#### 4. Language Improvements

- [ ] **Replace technical jargon**:
  - "6-character code" â†’ "easy join code (like MUS42K)"
  - Show example code in Step 3
  - Add Chromebook mention to Step 1: "Works on Chromebooks, iPads, and PCs"

**Refs**:
- QA Issue: `docs/qa/gates/22.1-ux-educator.yml:68-80`
- Tutorial: `src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/EducatorTutorial.tsx`

---

### Nice-to-Have

#### 5. Progress Tracking Updates

- [ ] **Update progress indicators**:
  - Step 1: "Step 1 of 5" (was "1 of 4")
  - Step 2: "Step 2 of 5" (Interactive visual learning)
  - Step 3: "Step 3 of 5" (Jam Sessions)
  - Step 4: "Step 4 of 5" (Accessibility)
  - Step 5: "Ready to Teach!" (Completion with pricing)

- [ ] **Tutorial duration update**:
  - Step 1: Change "45s tutorial" to "55s tutorial"
  - Actual duration: ~55 seconds (within 60s tolerance)

---

## Impact & Success Metrics

### Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before (Baseline) | After (Target) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **UX Score** | 68/100 (CONCERNS) | 85-92 (PASS) |
| **Bailout Risk** | 50% | <15% |
| **Critical Issues** | 3 | 0 |
| **Tutorial Completion Rate** | Unknown (measure) | 75%+ |
| **Trial Signup Rate (Educators)** | Unknown (measure) | 30%+ |

### Business Impact

- **Conversion**: Educators can request budget approval (pricing provided)
- **Trust**: Visual learning and accessibility proven (not just claimed)
- **Inclusive Education**: Demonstrates support for Deaf/HOH students
- **Viral Growth**: Educators share with colleagues (proven classroom tool)

### User Quotes (Expected)

**Before**: "You told me about visual learning but never showed it. I can't commit without proof."

**After**: "I SAW the color-coded notes! And the accessibility features are perfect for my Deaf students. $199/year? I can get that approved next week!"

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Chord Arranger Embed Complexity
**Mitigation**: Use existing ChordArranger component with `embeddedMode` prop (minimal refactoring)

### Risk 2: Tutorial Duration Creep (45s â†’ 55s)
**Mitigation**: 55 seconds still within 60s tolerance, acceptable tradeoff for proving claims

### Risk 3: Frequency Visualizer Performance
**Mitigation**: Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps, test on mid-range devices

### Risk 4: Pricing Scares Away Users
**Mitigation**: Emphasize "30-day free trial (no credit card)" to reduce risk perception

## Notes

- This story fixes Educator tutorial only. Musician tutorial has similar issues (see `docs/qa/assessments/22.1-ux-musician-20251025.md`).
- Consider creating Story 22.9 for Musician tutorial improvements (similar pattern).
- Chord Arranger embed pattern may be reusable for Visual Learner persona (22.1).
- Pricing section component reusable for Enterprise/Institution persona.
