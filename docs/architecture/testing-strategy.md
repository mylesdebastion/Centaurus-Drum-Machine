# Testing Strategy

## Integration with Existing Tests
**Existing Test Framework**: Test framework detection needed (Jest/Vitest likely with Vite setup)  
**Test Organization**: Hardware tests organized in `src/hardware/__tests__/` following existing patterns  
**Coverage Requirements**: Maintain existing coverage standards, target 80% for new hardware modules

## New Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests for New Components
- **Framework**: Same as existing project (Jest/Vitest with React Testing Library)
- **Location**: `src/hardware/__tests__/` directory structure
- **Coverage Target**: 80% line coverage for hardware modules
- **Integration with Existing**: Extends existing test configuration, no additional setup

### Integration Tests
- **Scope**: Hardware â†” sequencer state synchronization, Web MIDI API integration
- **Existing System Verification**: Automated tests verify sequencer continues functioning when hardware disconnected
- **New Feature Testing**: APC40 LED synchronization, button input handling, multi-device coordination

### Regression Testing
- **Existing Feature Verification**: Automated test suite ensures core sequencer, audio engine, and UI remain unchanged
- **Automated Regression Suite**: Hardware integration tests run alongside existing tests
- **Manual Testing Requirements**: Cross-browser testing for Web MIDI API, physical hardware testing with actual APC40
