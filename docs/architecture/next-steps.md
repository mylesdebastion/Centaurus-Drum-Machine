# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

"**For Story Manager**: This brownfield architecture document provides the technical foundation for implementing APC40 hardware controller integration. Key implementation requirements:

- **Reference Architecture**: Use this document (`docs/architecture.md`) and PRD (`docs/prd.md`) as technical specification
- **Integration Requirements Validated**: Hardware abstraction layer integrates through React Context, maintains complete isolation from existing components
- **Existing System Constraints**: All new code in `src/hardware/` module, zero modifications to existing components, follows established TypeScript/Tailwind patterns
- **First Story Priority**: Begin with **Story 1.1 - Hardware Abstraction Layer Foundation** to establish the architectural foundation before device-specific implementation
- **Integration Checkpoints**: Each story must verify existing sequencer functionality remains intact, hardware failures don't crash application, and React Context integration works correctly

The architecture maintains existing system integrity through complete component isolation and event-driven communication patterns."

## Developer Handoff

"**For Development Team**: Architecture and coding standards for APC40 hardware integration implementation:

- **Architecture Reference**: Follow component architecture defined in `docs/architecture.md`, all interfaces and patterns based on actual project analysis
- **Integration Requirements**: Hardware abstraction layer uses React Context API, follows existing component patterns, integrates with current Tone.js timing system
- **Technical Decisions**: Web MIDI API for hardware communication, TypeScript strict compliance, Tailwind CSS for consistency, localStorage for settings persistence
- **Compatibility Requirements**: Zero modifications to existing files outside `src/hardware/` module, existing component interfaces unchanged, audio engine performance maintained
- **Implementation Sequencing**: 
  1. Create hardware abstraction layer foundation (Story 1.1)
  2. Implement Web MIDI API integration (Story 1.2)  
  3. Add APC40-specific device communication (Story 1.3)
  4. Build LED synchronization system (Story 1.4)
  5. Enable multi-hardware coordination (Story 1.5)
  6. Integrate hardware UI components (Story 1.6)

Each implementation step must verify existing functionality remains intact and hardware module failures don't affect core application."
