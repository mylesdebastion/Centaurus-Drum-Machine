# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure
**Current Deployment**: Static web application built with Vite, deployed to static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel compatible)  
**Infrastructure Tools**: Vite build system, no server infrastructure, client-side only  
**Environments**: Development (localhost), Production (static hosting)

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy
**Deployment Approach**: **Zero Infrastructure Change**
- Hardware modules included in existing Vite build process
- No additional build steps or configuration required
- Web MIDI API available in all modern browsers (except Safari)

**Infrastructure Changes**: **Documentation Only**
- Add HTTPS requirement documentation for Web MIDI API
- Update development setup guide for local HTTPS serving
- No server infrastructure changes needed

**Pipeline Integration**: **Seamless Integration**
- Hardware TypeScript files included in existing build pipeline
- ESLint and TypeScript checks extend to hardware modules
- No additional deployment steps required

## Rollback Strategy
**Rollback Method**: **Feature Flag Pattern**
- Hardware manager checks for Web MIDI API availability
- Graceful degradation when hardware unsupported
- Application functions identically without hardware connected

**Risk Mitigation**: **Isolation Architecture**
- Hardware module failures don't affect core sequencer
- Complete separation between hardware and audio engine
- Independent error boundaries for hardware components

**Monitoring**: **Client-Side Logging**
- Hardware connection events logged to browser console
- Error tracking for Web MIDI API compatibility issues
- Performance monitoring for LED update latency
