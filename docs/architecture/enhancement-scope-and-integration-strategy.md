# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview

**Enhancement Type**: Hardware Integration with Modular Architecture  
**Scope**: Add APC40 MIDI controller support through new hardware abstraction layer while maintaining complete separation from existing drum sequencer core  
**Integration Impact**: Moderate - New module addition with event-based communication, no modifications to existing components

## Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy**: **Additive Architecture Pattern**
- Create new `src/hardware/` module tree completely separate from existing components
- Use React's existing event system and context patterns for communication
- Maintain existing component interfaces without modification
- Follow established TypeScript patterns and folder organization

**Database Integration**: **No Database Changes Required**  
- All hardware state managed in React component state and localStorage
- Follows existing pattern of client-side state management
- Hardware settings persist using same localStorage patterns as current app settings

**API Integration**: **Event-Driven Communication**
- Hardware modules communicate with drum sequencer through React's existing event system
- No new HTTP APIs - maintains current client-only architecture  
- Web MIDI API integration handled within hardware abstraction layer

**UI Integration**: **Component Composition Pattern**
- Hardware UI components follow existing Tailwind component patterns
- Hardware status integrated into existing layouts through composition
- Settings panel extends existing modal/settings architecture
- Maintains responsive behavior through existing Tailwind breakpoint system

## Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility**: All current component props, interfaces, and exports remain unchanged
- **Database Schema Compatibility**: No schema changes (no database in current architecture)  
- **UI/UX Consistency**: Hardware UI follows existing Tailwind design tokens, spacing, and interaction patterns
- **Performance Impact**: Hardware layer operates independently with <5% performance overhead on existing functionality
