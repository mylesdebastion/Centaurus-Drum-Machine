# Persona-Driven UX Testing with BMAD QA Agent

BMAD extension for visual UX analysis from persona perspectives using Playwright screenshot capture and AI-powered critique.

## Overview

This testing framework extends the BMAD QA agent to evaluate user experience from specific persona viewpoints, catching issues that traditional code review and functional testing miss:

- **Visual hierarchy problems** - What draws attention first?
- **Layout issues** - Alignment, spacing, responsive breakpoints
- **Cognitive load** - Too much text, unclear CTAs, jargon
- **Emotional response** - Intimidating, boring, exciting, confusing
- **Persona-specific friction** - Features not aligned with goals

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. One-Time Setup

```bash
cd testing/persona-ux
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev  # From project root
```

### 3. Capture Screenshots

```bash
cd testing/persona-ux
node capture-flow.js --persona=m
```

### 4. Run UX Review

```bash
@qa *ux-review 22.1 --persona=m
```

**Output:**
- Gate file: `docs/qa/gates/22.1-ux-m.yml`
- Report: `docs/qa/assessments/22.1-ux-m-20250125.md`
- Annotated screenshots: `testing/persona-ux/feedback/m/`

## How It Works

### 1. Playwright Captures Screenshots

The capture script navigates through the tutorial flow and takes screenshots at each step for both mobile and desktop viewports.

**What it captures:**
- Initial landing/selector screen
- Each tutorial step
- Completion/CTA screen
- Mobile viewport (375px - iPhone SE)
- Desktop viewport (1920px)

### 2. QA Agent Embodies Persona

The QA agent loads persona context from `.bmad-core/data/persona-contexts.md`:

**For Musician (m):**
- Goals: "Quick creative jamming with minimal setup"
- Frustrations: "Setup hell, technical jargon, too many steps"
- Bailout triggers: "Tutorial >5 steps, see 'configuration', need to read paragraphs"
- Language: Music terms YES, tech terms NO

The agent then "becomes" that persona, viewing the UX through their lens.

### 3. Visual Analysis Framework

For each screenshot, the agent evaluates 5 categories using `.bmad-core/data/ux-analysis-framework.md`:

1. **Visual Hierarchy** - Primary CTA obvious? Text flow clear?
2. **Layout & Responsiveness** - Aligned? Spaced? Mobile works?
3. **Cognitive Load** - Scannable? Clear choices? No jargon?
4. **Emotional Response** - Right tone? Builds trust? Engaging?
5. **Persona-Specific Friction** - Supports goals? No bailout triggers?

Each category scored: PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL

### 4. Issue Identification & Scoring

The agent identifies issues with severity:
- **CRITICAL**: Blocks persona goal, triggers bailout (-20 points)
- **MAJOR**: Significant degradation (-10 points)
- **MINOR**: Polish issue (-2 points)

**UX Score:**
```
Base = 100
Final Score = 100 - (20√óCRITICAL) - (10√óMAJOR) - (2√óMINOR)
```

### 5. Gate Decision

```
Score ‚â•80: PASS
Score 60-79: CONCERNS
Score <60: FAIL

Overrides:
- Emotional Response FAIL ‚Üí FAIL (engagement critical)
- Cannot complete goal ‚Üí FAIL
- ‚â•3 CRITICAL issues ‚Üí FAIL
```

### 6. Outputs

- **Language**: "Jam, beat, loop" YES / "MIDI, buffer, latency" NO
- **Tone**: Casual, excited, action-oriented

### Educator (e) - üìö
- **Goal**: Engage students, teach rhythm/composition
- **Bailout**: Student distractions (chat), account requirements, >2min setup
- **Language**: "Lesson, activity, students" YES / "Jam, friends, game" NO
- **Tone**: Professional, educational, clear

### Visual Learner (v) - üëÅÔ∏è
- **Goal**: Understand music through visual patterns
- **Bailout**: Text-heavy tutorials, no visual feedback, audio-only cues
- **Language**: "Grid, colors, see, watch" YES / "Listen, quarter note" NO
- **Tone**: Visual-first, interactive

### Producer (p) - üéöÔ∏è
- **Goal**: Fast idea capture, integrate with DAW

- **Tone**: Technical, professional, efficiency-focused

## Workflow

### First-Time Review

1. **Capture**
   ```bash
   node capture-flow.js --persona=m
   ```

2. **Review**
   ```bash
   @qa *ux-review 22.1 --persona=m
   ```

3. **Analyze**
   - Gate file: Quick status (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL)
   - Markdown report: Detailed findings
   - Annotated screenshots: Visual evidence

4. **Fix**
   - Address CRITICAL issues first
   - Implement recommendations

5. **Baseline** (optional)
   ```bash
   cp -r testing/persona-ux/screenshots/m/ testing/persona-ux/baseline/m/
   ```

### Re-Review After Fixes

1. **Re-capture**
   ```bash
   node capture-flow.js --persona=m
   ```

2. **Review with baseline**
   ```bash
   @qa *ux-review 22.1 --persona=m --baseline
   ```

3. **Compare**
   - Before: 65/100 (CONCERNS)
   - After: 85/100 (PASS)
   - Improvement: +20 points
   - Issues resolved: 2 CRITICAL, 3 MAJOR

### Testing All Personas

```bash
# Capture all
for persona in m e v p; do
  node capture-flow.js --persona=$persona
done

# Review all
@qa *ux-review 22.1 --persona=all
```

Final gate = worst individual persona result

### Markdown Report Excerpt

```markdown
## Screenshot 2: Step 2 - Equipment Setup (Desktop)

**First Impression (Musician):** "Wait, what? MIDI controller? Audio buffer size? I thought this was for jamming, not audio engineering!"

### Visual Hierarchy: CONCERNS
- Primary CTA ("Next") is visible but...
- Text wall dominates attention (bad)
- Technical terms in bold (scares non-tech users)

### Cognitive Load: FAIL ‚ùå
- Paragraph 6 sentences long (max 2-3)
- Technical jargon unexplained: "MIDI controller", "audio buffer", "sample rate"
- Assumes knowledge Musician doesn't have
- **CRITICAL Issue**: Musician bailout trigger HIT ("configuration" mentioned)

**Persona Voice:** "I don't know what half of this means. Do I need to buy equipment? This is too complicated - I'm just gonna close this and try something else."

### Emotional Response: FAIL ‚ùå
- Tone feels technical/intimidating (not casual/fun)
- Creates anxiety ("Am I missing something?")
- No excitement/anticipation
- **CRITICAL Issue**: Destroys trust ("Maybe this isn't for me")

**Annotated Screenshot:** [Link to marked-up image with red boxes around jargon]

### Suggested Fix (Immediate):

**Current Text:**
> "To get the best audio experience, connect your MIDI controller and configure your audio buffer size to 128 samples for optimal latency."

**Proposed Text:**
> "üéπ Got a keyboard or controller? Plug it in! (Or just use your computer keyboard - works great!)"

**Why:** Removes jargon, makes gear optional, uses emojis for casual tone, reassures it works without equipment.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Capture frequently** - After any UX changes
2. **Use baselines** - Track improvements over time
3. **Test all personas** - Each sees UX differently
4. **Address CRITICAL first** - Emotional Response/Friction fails
5. **Iterate quickly** - Capture ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Re-capture (10 min cycle)
