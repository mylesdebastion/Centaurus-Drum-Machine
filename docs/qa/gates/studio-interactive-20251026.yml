          const [audioReady, setAudioReady] = useState(false);

          const initializeAudio = async () => {

      - action: "Implement graceful fallback if audio fails (silent mode with visual feedback)"

    long_term:
      - action: "Add comprehensive audio engine status monitoring"
      - action: "Implement error recovery (auto-retry initialization)"
      - action: "Add user-accessible audio troubleshooting panel"

  score_breakdown:
    ui_interactions: 85  # Buttons, sliders work well
    audio_functionality: 0  # Completely broken
    error_handling: 20  # Errors logged but not recovered
    user_feedback: 40  # Visual feedback works, no audio error messages
    overall: 36  # (85 + 0 + 20 + 40) / 4 = 36.25

final_score: 36
final_gate: FAIL

gate_override_reason: |
  Core audio functionality (the primary purpose of a drum machine) is completely non-functional.
  While UI interactions work correctly, the application cannot produce sound,
  rendering it unusable for its intended purpose. Must fix before any launch.
