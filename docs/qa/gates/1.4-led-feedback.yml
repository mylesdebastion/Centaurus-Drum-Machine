# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.4: LED Feedback and Visual Synchronization

schema: 1
story: "1.4"
story_title: "Real-time LED Feedback and Visual Synchronization"
gate: "FAIL"
status_reason: "Critical hardware compatibility issues prevent LED functionality on real APC40 devices. Implementation uses incompatible MIDI note ranges and LED control methods."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

waiver: { active: false }

top_issues:
  - id: "HW-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "LED implementation uses wrong MIDI note range (53-92) - APC40 clip grid uses 0-39 for LED control"
    suggested_action: "Update midiMapping.ts to use correct APC40 clip grid notes (0x00-0x27)"
  - id: "HW-002"
    severity: high
    finding: "LED control uses custom SysEx format instead of proven MIDI Note On messages"
    suggested_action: "Switch from SysEx LED control to direct MIDI Note On [0x90, note, color] as demonstrated in working artifact"
  - id: "HW-003"
    severity: high
    finding: "Device initialization uses Generic Mode instead of proven Ableton Live Mode"
    suggested_action: "Update constants.ts to use Ableton Live Mode SysEx: [0xF0, 0x47, 0x7F, 0x29, 0x60, 0x00, 0x04, 0x41, 0x09, 0x07, 0x01, 0xF7]"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Tests pass but validate incorrect implementation - mocks hide hardware incompatibility"
    suggested_action: "Update tests after hardware compatibility fixes to validate real device behavior"

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix MIDI note mapping for APC40 compatibility"
      - "Switch to proven LED control method"
      - "Update device mode initialization"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns with LED feedback implementation"
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Performance optimization exists but for wrong hardware interface - needs validation with correct implementation"
  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: "Core functionality fails on real hardware due to incompatible MIDI mapping"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code is well-structured and documented, will be easy to fix"

quality_score: 40  # 100 - (20*1 FAIL) - (10*4 CONCERNS/HIGH) = 40
