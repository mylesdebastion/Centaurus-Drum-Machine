# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.2
schema: 1
story: "1.2"
story_title: "Web MIDI API Integration and Browser Compatibility"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent architecture and complete feature implementation, but 13 failing tests need resolution before production deployment"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-01-12T18:00:00Z"

# Issues requiring attention
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "13 out of 141 tests failing, primarily in browser compatibility detection and connection manager timing"
    suggested_action: "Fix Safari detection mocking, stabilize timer-dependent tests, align error messages with implementation"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Some tests depend on specific timing/race conditions making them flaky"
    suggested_action: "Refactor timer-based tests to be more deterministic or use fake timers properly"
    suggested_owner: dev
