      description: 'Step 1 explains Piano Roll with text bullets instead of showing visual grid'

      persona_voice: "Wait, you're TELLING me how it works? I need to SEE it! Show me the actual Piano Roll grid with notes so I can understand the pattern visually."
      what_would_help_me: "Show me a mini Piano Roll demo with a simple melody already on it. Let me SEE horizontal=time and vertical=pitch instead of reading about it. Even just a static image would help!"
      suggested_fix: 'Replace 4-bullet text explanation with embedded mini Piano Roll showing sample pattern'

      persona_voice: "You're describing colors with WORDS? That defeats the whole purpose! SHOW me what Rainbow mode looks like with actual colors on a grid!"
      what_would_help_me: "Show me 3 small grid examples side-by-side: one in Rainbow mode, one in Scale Degrees, one in Chord Tones. I need to SEE the difference, not read about it."
      suggested_fix: 'Replace text descriptions with 3 visual previews showing color modes in action'

      persona_voice: "This is a lot of reading for someone who learns visually. Can't you just show me?"
      what_would_help_me: "Reduce bullets to 1-2 max, or better yet, replace with interactive demo."
      suggested_fix: 'Reduce bullet list to 2 items max or replace with visual demonstration'

      persona_voice: "I have to read all 3 descriptions to understand the difference? Just show me a quick visual comparison."
      what_would_help_me: "Side-by-side visual examples would take 2 seconds to understand vs 20 seconds to read."
      suggested_fix: 'Add thumbnail previews for each color mode showing the visual difference'
