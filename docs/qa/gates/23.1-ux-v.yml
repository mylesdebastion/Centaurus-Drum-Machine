      persona_voice: '"Wait, where is the color mode selector? The piano is already rainbow! The tooltip says ''Click the color mode selector'' but I don''t see it. Am I supposed to click those buttons at the top? I''m confused and feel dumb."'
      what_would_help_me: '"Show me WHERE to click! Put a blue highlight ring on the color mode selector buttons so I can see them. Or if I''m already in Rainbow mode, tell me ''Great! Try clicking a key to hear the sound.'' Don''t make me search for a button I can''t find!"'
      suggested_fix: 'Add data-tour="color-mode-selector" attribute to color mode buttons in Piano Roll AND ensure they are visible/in-view during tour step. Alternatively, adjust tour step to highlight piano keyboard first if already in Rainbow mode.'

  recommendations:
    immediate:  # Fix before launch
      - 'Fix Step 1: Make color mode selector visible and highlighted, OR skip color mode selection if already in Rainbow mode'
      - 'Verify data-tour="color-mode-selector" attribute exists and targets correct element'
      - 'Test tour flow to ensure color mode buttons are in viewport when step 1 displays'
    future:  # Nice to have improvements
      - 'Hide MIDI Setup section by default when Piano Roll loaded via preset'
      - 'Add smart tour step logic to skip already-completed steps (e.g., if already in Rainbow mode)'
      - 'Add visual confirmation when user successfully selects color mode'

  notes: |
    Epic 23 iOS-style tooltip redesign has MIXED results for Visual Learners.

    What's Working:
    - ✅ Rainbow piano is PERFECT (addresses "no sheet music" pain point)
    - ✅ "No sheet music needed" message addresses core intimidation
    - ✅ iOS-style tooltips are non-intrusive (no modal blocking)
    - ✅ Preset auto-loads Piano Roll with colors

    What's Broken:
    - ❌ Step 1 instruction mismatch (can't find color selector)
    - ❌ Confusion about current color mode state
    - ⚠️ Technical MIDI text is intimidating (though ignorable)

    Root Cause:
    The color mode selector buttons are either:
    1. Not in viewport when step 1 tooltip displays, OR
    2. Not highlighted/obvious to user, OR
    3. Missing data-tour attribute

    This creates a critical UX breakdown for visual learners (who rely on SEEING elements).
    The tour instructs them to click something they can't find, causing confusion and
    making them feel "dumb" - exactly the opposite of the empowering experience intended.

    Impact:
    - Visual Learners may abandon tutorial at step 1 (high bounce risk)
    - Confusion undermines initial excitement from step 0
    - Persona needs clear visual guidance (this fails that need)

    Recommended Fix Priority: HIGH
    This should be fixed before Epic 23 ships to ensure Visual Learner persona
    has successful onboarding experience.
