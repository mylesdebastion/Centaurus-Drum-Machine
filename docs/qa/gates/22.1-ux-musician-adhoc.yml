  bailout_assessment:
    bailout_triggers_hit:
      - "Technical jargon: 'modular workspace' (Step 2)"
      - "Reading paragraphs instead of making music (Step 2)"
      - "Tutorial doesn't deliver on promise (no music created)"
    bailout_probability: 40%
    bailout_point: "Step 2 (Music Studio explanation) or completion (hollow victory)"
    reasoning: "Musician expects immediate action. Text wall at Step 2 breaks flow. Completion without hearing music creates distrust."

  recommendations:
    immediate:
      - action: "Remove Step 2 (Music Studio explanation)"
        impact: "Saves 10s, reduces cognitive load, eliminates jargon"
        effort: "1 hour"
        refs: ['src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/MusicianTutorial.tsx']

      - action: "Add interactive beat creation in tutorial"
        impact: "Delivers on 30-second promise, builds trust, creates wow moment"
        effort: "4 hours"
        refs: ['src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/MusicianTutorial.tsx']
        details: |
          Step 2 (new): User clicks 4 Kick squares
          Step 3 (new): User clicks 2 Snare squares
          Step 4 (new): User hits Play, HEARS beat (5-10s loop)
          Step 5 (new): Celebration with "You made music!" + Launch Studio

      - action: "Move celebration screen AFTER music creation"
        impact: "Earns the checkmark, feels authentic"
        effort: "30 minutes"
        refs: ['src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/MusicianTutorial.tsx']

    future:
      - action: "Add visual beat preview on Step 1"
        impact: "Show what they'll create, builds anticipation"
        effort: "2 hours"

      - action: "Consider single-path onboarding (skip persona selection)"
        impact: "Reduces decision overhead, faster to music"
        effort: "8 hours (requires product discussion)"

      - action: "Add skip tutorial option for impatient users"
        impact: "Respects user agency, reduces friction"
        effort: "1 hour"

  positive_findings:
    - "Step 1 perfectly matches Musician expectations (clear promise, simple CTA)"
    - "Visual hierarchy consistently strong (clear CTAs, good color use)"
    - "No account requirement messaging builds trust"
    - "30-second promise is bold and attractive"
    - "Mobile layouts appear clean and functional"

  overall_assessment: |
    The Musician tutorial has excellent bones (clear visuals, good copy, strong promise)
    but fundamentally breaks its core promise: creating a beat in 30 seconds.

    User reads ABOUT making music but never MAKES music during tutorial.
    This creates a hollow victory at completion and 40% risk of bailout.

    The fix is simple but critical: let users actually create and HEAR a beat
    during the tutorial. Remove the explanatory Step 2, add interactive
    beat creation, move celebration after the music plays.

    With these changes, score would jump to 90+ (PASS) and deliver on promise.
