      description: 'Tutorial never mentions export/download capabilities - critical for producer trust'

      persona_voice: "Wait, can I export my work? I need to be able to download MIDI and WAV stems to finish in Ableton. If this is just a browser toy with no export, I'm out."
      what_would_help_me: "Tell me early (Step 1 or 2) that I can 'Export MIDI/WAV stems to continue in your desktop DAW' - that's the key feature that makes this a pro tool, not a toy."
      suggested_fix: 'Add export capability mention to Step 1 module list or Step 3 workflow'

      description: 'No technical specs mentioned (latency, sample rate, audio quality) - producers care about this'
      screenshot: 'testing/persona-ux/screenshots/adhoc-p/adhoc-p-step2-desktop-20251025-1426.png'
      persona_voice: "MIDI support is great, but what about latency? What sample rate? Is this actually usable for production or will I get audio glitches?"
      what_would_help_me: "Mention 'Low-latency audio engine' or 'Professional-grade 48kHz audio' somewhere to build confidence in audio quality."
      suggested_fix: 'Add brief technical spec callout to Step 2 or landing page'

      description: 'Completion screen emphasizes "Free tier" instead of Pro value - producers are willing to pay'

      persona_voice: "Free tier available? I don't care about free - I want to know if Pro gives me unlimited exports and advanced modules. Sell me on quality, not price."
      what_would_help_me: "Instead of 'Free tier available', say 'Upgrade to Pro for unlimited exports, advanced modules, and priority support' - tell me what I get, not what's cheap."
      suggested_fix: 'Reframe Pro tier messaging to emphasize value, not free option'

      description: 'Step 1 module list could show sample count (6+ modules vs just listing 6)'
      screenshot: 'testing/persona-ux/screenshots/adhoc-p/adhoc-p-step1-desktop-20251025-1426.png'
      persona_voice: "6 modules? Is that all? BandLab has 20+. How do I know this has enough tools?"
      what_would_help_me: "Say '30+ production modules including:' then list 6 examples - shows depth without overwhelming."
      suggested_fix: 'Change heading to indicate total module count'
