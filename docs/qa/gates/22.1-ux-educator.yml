      persona_voice: "You promised I could 'teach music visually' but I never SAW students learning visually! The Chord Arranger sounds great, but SHOW me the color-coded notes, SHOW me students seeing theory as they create. I need to see this working before I bring it to my classroom."
      what_would_help_me: "Embed a live preview of the Chord Arranger with color-coded notes. Let me click a chord and SEE the visual feedback. Show me what my students will experience, not just tell me about it."
      suggested_fix: "Add interactive Chord Arranger preview in Step 2 - let educator click C major chord and see color visualization"

      persona_voice: "I teach Deaf and hard-of-hearing students. You said this is 'inclusive for everyone' in the landing page, but WHERE are the accessibility features? I need to know students can SEE music, not just hear it. This is a dealbreaker for my classroom."
      what_would_help_me: "Add a step showing visual feedback features: color-coded notes, visual waveforms, frequency visualizer. Say explicitly: 'Students can SEE music - perfect for Deaf/HOH learners.'"
      suggested_fix: "Add Step 4: Accessibility Tour showing visual music features and stating 'Accessible for Deaf, HOH, and visual learners'"

  bailout_assessment:
    bailout_triggers_hit:
      - "Missing accessibility features (critical for inclusive classroom mandate)"
      - "No pricing information (can't request budget approval without it)"
      - "Visual learning not demonstrated (tutorial told, didn't show)"
    bailout_probability: 50%
    bailout_point: "Completion screen (realizes accessibility features weren't shown, pricing unknown)"
    reasoning: "Educator is excited by collaboration features but can't commit without: (1) seeing visual learning in action, (2) knowing accessibility works for diverse students, (3) having a price to present to administration"

  recommendations:
    immediate:
      - action: "Add interactive visual learning demo in Step 2"
        impact: "Shows color-coded notes, proves 'teach visually' claim"
        effort: "4 hours"
        refs: ['src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/EducatorTutorial.tsx']

      - action: "Add Accessibility Tour step (Step 4)"
        impact: "Shows visual feedback for Deaf/HOH, addresses inclusive mandate"
        effort: "3 hours"
        refs: ['src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/EducatorTutorial.tsx']

      - action: "Add pricing to completion screen"
        impact: "Enables budget approval process, removes friction"
        effort: "30 minutes"
        refs: ['src/components/Onboarding/tutorials/EducatorTutorial.tsx']

    future:
      - action: "Replace technical jargon with teacher-friendly language"
        impact: "Reduces cognitive load for non-tech educators"
        effort: "1 hour"

      - action: "Add explicit Chromebook compatibility badge"
        impact: "Confirms IT infrastructure compatibility"
        effort: "30 minutes"

  positive_findings:
    - "Step 1 clearly states 'no software installation' (addresses IT approval pain point)"
    - "Collaboration focus (Jam Session) aligns perfectly with classroom teaching goals"
    - "Tutorial duration (45s) is appropriate for educator evaluation"
    - "'Ready to Teach!' completion messaging uses persona-appropriate language"
    - "Two CTAs give flexibility (explore solo or start class session immediately)"

  overall_assessment: |
    The Educator tutorial has strong collaboration messaging and addresses
    the "no installation" pain point, but fails to deliver on its core
    promise: visual music education for inclusive classrooms.

    Three critical gaps:
    1. No visual learning demonstration (told about Chord Arranger, never shown)
    2. Accessibility features completely absent (dealbreaker for inclusive education)
    3. No pricing information (blocks budget approval process)

    The tutorial feels like it's describing a great product but not showing it.
    Educators need to SEE visual learning in action and CONFIRM accessibility
    features work before committing to a classroom tool.

    With fixes, score would jump to 85+ (PASS). Without fixes, 50% bailout risk
    at completion when educator realizes they don't have enough info to proceed.
