    Epic 23 iOS-style tooltip redesign is a SUCCESS for Musicians!

    Key Wins:
    - No modal/backdrop blocking view (CRITICAL fix from baseline)
    - Preset auto-loads Drum Machine (immediate gratification)
    - Clear action guidance ("Click any box")
    - "30 seconds" promise feels achievable
    - No technical jargon (avoids bailout triggers)

    The new tooltip design perfectly addresses Musician persona needs:
    - Quick onboarding (no long text)
    - Hands-on interaction (click boxes immediately)
    - Visual learning (see the grid, not read instructions)

    Minor tooltip positioning issue is negligible - user focus is on the highlighted grid.
