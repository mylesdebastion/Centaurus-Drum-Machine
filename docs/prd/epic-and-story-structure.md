# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single Epic with 5-6 coordinated stories  

**Rationale**: The APC40 integration represents a cohesive feature set that introduces hardware abstraction as a new capability to your drum sequencer. While technically complex, it's a unified enhancement with clear dependencies between the hardware abstraction layer, APC40-specific implementation, and UI integration. Breaking this into multiple epics would create artificial boundaries and complicate the integration testing and rollout strategy.

The stories are logically sequential with each building on the previous foundation, making this ideal for a single epic approach that can be developed and deployed as a unified capability.
