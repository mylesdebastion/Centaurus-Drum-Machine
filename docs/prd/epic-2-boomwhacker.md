# PRD: Virtual Boomwhacker Music Learning Application (3D Enhanced)

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a proof-of-concept virtual music education application that transforms user-input melodies and drum patterns into interactive 3D visual learning experiences inspired by boomwhacker classroom videos. The application is designed as a separate experimental module that will either integrate into the existing jam session or potentially replace the jam session UX based on A/B testing results. The application generates synchronized visual cues using a forward-moving 3D note visualization system with color-coded interfaces that guide users through musical performances, creating an immersive depth-based timing experience.

- **Audio Continuity**: Playback continues uninterrupted regardless of active mode
- **Real-Time Updates**: Both modes stay synchronized during playback

## 19. Interactive System Technical Specifications

### 19.1 3D Click Detection System
- **Ray Casting**: Use Three.js Raycaster for precise 3D object intersection detection
- **Hit Testing**: Efficient collision detection for moving notes and static strike zones
- **Touch Area Expansion**: Expand hit areas for mobile touch targets (44px minimum)
- **Z-Buffer Priority**: Handle overlapping notes with proper depth-based selection
- **Performance Optimization**: Spatial partitioning for efficient click detection with many notes

### 19.2 Audio Preview Architecture
```javascript
class InteractiveAudioSystem {
  constructor(audioEngine) {
    this.audioEngine = audioEngine;
    this.previewGain = 0.7; // Slightly quieter than main playback
  }
  
  playNotePreview(noteType, velocity = 0.8) {
    // Play immediately without affecting main timeline
    this.audioEngine.playDrum(noteType, velocity * this.previewGain);
  }
  
  playStrikeZonePreview(laneIndex) {
    const noteType = this.getLaneNoteType(laneIndex);
    this.playNotePreview(noteType);
  }
}
```

### 19.3 Touch and Mouse Event Handling
- **Unified Event System**: Single handler for both mouse and touch events
- **Gesture Recognition**: Distinguish between tap, long-press, and drag gestures
- **Multi-Touch Support**: Handle multiple simultaneous touches for chord previews
- **Event Debouncing**: Prevent rapid-fire audio triggers from accidental multiple taps
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support for interactive elements

### 19.4 Visual Feedback System
- **Click Animation**: Brief scale/color change on interactive element activation
- **Hover States**: Visual indication of interactive elements (desktop only)
- **Touch Ripple**: Material Design-style ripple effect for touch interactions
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during audio loading or processing
- **Error States**: Clear indication when interactions fail or audio unavailable

### 19.5 Mobile-Specific Interaction Patterns
- **Touch Target Sizing**: Minimum 44px touch targets with adequate spacing
- **Gesture Shortcuts**: Swipe gestures for mode switching and navigation
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration feedback on supported devices for note hits
- **Long-Press Actions**: Context menus or additional options via long-press
- **Pinch-to-Zoom**: 3D view zoom controls for better visibility on small screens

## 20. Responsive UI Architecture

### 20.1 Layout Component Structure
```javascript
// Main responsive container
<BoomwhackerApp>
  <ResponsiveLayoutManager breakpoint={currentBreakpoint}>
    <DesktopLayout>
      <SequencerPanel />
      <ThreeDView />
    </DesktopLayout>
    
    <TabletLayout>
      <ThreeDView />
      <SequencerPanel />
    </TabletLayout>
    
    <MobileLayout>
      <ViewToggle currentMode={viewMode} onToggle={setViewMode} />
      {viewMode === 'sequencer' ? <SequencerPanel /> : <ThreeDView />}
      <QuickControls /> {/* Play/pause, tempo always visible */}
    </MobileLayout>
  </ResponsiveLayoutManager>
</BoomwhackerApp>
```

### 20.2 State Management for View Modes
- **Global State**: Current view mode (sequencer/3D) persisted across sessions
- **Breakpoint Detection**: Real-time responsive breakpoint monitoring
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for mode switching animations
- **State Synchronization**: Pattern data synchronized between both views
- **Performance Optimization**: Pause non-visible view rendering to save resources

### 20.3 Mobile Navigation Patterns
- **Tab Bar Style**: Bottom navigation with clear mode indicators
- **Swipe Gestures**: Horizontal swipe to switch between modes
- **Quick Access**: Essential controls (play/pause/tempo) always accessible
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear indication of current active mode
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

### 20.4 Performance Considerations
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only render active view on mobile to save resources
- **3D Scene Pausing**: Pause 3D animation when sequencer mode is active on mobile
- **Memory Management**: Efficient cleanup when switching between views
- **Touch Optimization**: Debounced touch events to prevent performance issues
- **Battery Optimization**: Reduce frame rate and effects on mobile devices
