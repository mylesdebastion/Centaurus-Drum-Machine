# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis combined with comprehensive research document

**Current Project State**: 
The Centaurus Drum Machine is a web-based drum sequencer built with React/TypeScript, utilizing Tone.js for audio synthesis and Web Audio API for real-time audio processing. The application features:
- React-based component architecture with TypeScript
- Real-time step sequencer with 16-step patterns
- Audio engine using Tone.js synthesizers (MembraneSynth, NoiseSynth, MetalSynth)
- Visual feedback system with customizable color modes
- Responsive design with mobile/desktop layouts
- Educational mode for teaching rhythm programming

## Available Documentation Analysis

✅ **Tech Stack Documentation** (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Tone.js)  
✅ **Source Tree/Architecture** (component-based architecture identified)  
❌ **Coding Standards** (inferred from existing code patterns)  
❌ **API Documentation** (internal API structure needs documentation)  
❌ **External API Documentation** (Web Audio API usage documented in code)  
✅ **UX/UI Guidelines** (Tailwind-based design system evident)  
❌ **Technical Debt Documentation** (minimal, recent clean codebase)  

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ Integration with New Systems (APC40 hardware MIDI controller)

**Enhancement Description**: 
Integration of Akai APC40 MIDI hardware controller with the existing web-based drum sequencer to provide real-time LED feedback synchronized with the sequencer state, bidirectional communication for hardware button control, and professional hardware interaction for music production workflows.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes required)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Enable professional hardware control of the web-based drum sequencer
- Provide real-time LED visual feedback synchronized with sequencer playback
- Support bidirectional communication between hardware and web interface
- Maintain cross-browser compatibility while adding Web MIDI functionality
- Ensure seamless integration without disrupting existing functionality

**Background Context**:
The current web-based drum sequencer provides an excellent foundation for rhythm programming but lacks the tactile hardware interaction that professional producers expect. The APC40 integration addresses this gap by providing physical buttons with LED feedback, making the application suitable for live performance and professional studio use. The comprehensive research document provides detailed technical implementation strategies for Web MIDI API integration, LED synchronization, and hardware compatibility requirements.
