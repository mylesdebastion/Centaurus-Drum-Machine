# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

The APC40 hardware module integration will maintain complete consistency with the existing Tailwind CSS-based design system and React component architecture. The enhancement will add:

**Hardware Status Components**:
- Connection indicator showing APC40 status (connected/disconnected/error)  
- Hardware module selector/manager for multi-device scenarios
- LED brightness and color mode controls specific to APC40 capabilities

**Visual Feedback Enhancements**:  
- Current hardware-controlled step highlighting in web UI
- Real-time synchronization indicators showing hardware â†” software state alignment
- Hardware module activity indicators (which device last modified which elements)

All new UI elements will follow existing component patterns, use established color schemes, and maintain the current responsive behavior.

## Modified/New Screens and Views

**Enhanced Main Sequencer View**:
- Hardware connection status panel (minimal, non-intrusive)
- Hardware module tabs/selector (when multiple devices connected)
- Enhanced step indicator showing hardware/software input sources

**New Hardware Settings Panel**:
- APC40-specific configuration (LED brightness, color modes, button sensitivity)
- Multi-hardware coordination settings 
- Device pairing and management interface

**Enhanced Mobile/Responsive Views**:
- Hardware status remains visible in mobile navigation
- Hardware settings accessible through existing settings modal
- Graceful degradation messaging for unsupported browsers (Safari)

## UI Consistency Requirements

**Visual Consistency**: All hardware-related UI elements use existing Tailwind utility classes and component patterns  
**Interaction Consistency**: Hardware controls follow existing button, slider, and modal interaction patterns  
**Responsive Consistency**: Hardware UI elements maintain responsive behavior across all screen sizes  
**Accessibility Consistency**: Hardware status and controls meet existing accessibility standards and keyboard navigation patterns  
**State Management Consistency**: Hardware UI state integrates with existing React state management patterns without introducing new paradigms
