# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: A new APC40 module will be created as an independent hardware interface that connects to the existing drum sequencer core without modifying existing functionality  
**FR2**: The APC40 module will implement its own custom 8x5 grid mapping optimized for the APC40's physical layout and capabilities  
**FR3**: A hardware abstraction layer will enable multiple hardware modules to interface with the core sequencer simultaneously  
**FR4**: The APC40 module will subscribe to sequencer state changes and translate them to appropriate LED patterns using APC40-specific MIDI implementation  
**FR5**: Hardware modules will communicate with the drum sequencer through a standardized event system, allowing real-world hardware modules to interface with each other  
**FR6**: The APC40 module will handle its own connection management, MIDI mapping, and device-specific features (SysEx mode switching, LED animations)  
**FR7**: The core drum sequencer remains hardware-agnostic and will continue to function independently when no hardware modules are connected  
**FR8**: Future hardware modules (Launchpad, Push, custom controllers) can be added without modifying existing modules or core sequencer  
**FR9**: Hardware modules can be connected/disconnected during operation without affecting core sequencer or other hardware modules  
**FR10**: Multiple hardware modules can operate simultaneously, each with specialized functions while sharing core sequencer state  
**FR11**: Inter-hardware communication enables coordinated behaviors (pattern changes trigger scene updates across controllers)  
**FR12**: Hardware failure or disconnection provides graceful degradation without system crashes or state loss  

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: LED update latency must not exceed 50ms to maintain tight synchronization with audio playback  
**NFR2**: Enhancement must maintain existing audio engine performance and not introduce audio dropouts or timing drift  
**NFR3**: Web MIDI integration must not impact existing mobile responsiveness or desktop performance  
**NFR4**: Hardware connection/disconnection must not crash the application or lose current sequencer state  
**NFR5**: HTTPS serving requirement for Web MIDI API must be documented with development workflow guidance  
**NFR6**: Memory usage increase from MIDI integration must not exceed 15% of current baseline  
**NFR7**: Hardware module hot-swap operations must complete within 2 seconds to avoid performance disruption  
**NFR8**: Multi-hardware synchronization must maintain <10ms latency between connected devices  

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing API compatibility - All current component interfaces and prop structures must remain unchanged  
**CR2**: Database schema compatibility - No database changes required (state remains client-side)  
**CR3**: UI/UX consistency - Hardware integration must not alter existing visual design or interaction patterns  
**CR4**: Integration compatibility - New MIDI layer must integrate cleanly with existing audio engine and React state management
