# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Frameworks**: React 18.2.0, Vite 5.0.8 (build tool)  
**Audio Engine**: Tone.js 15.1.22, Web Audio API  
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.6, CSS custom properties  
**UI Components**: Lucide React (icons), custom component library  
**Build/Dev**: Vite with TypeScript, PostCSS, Autoprefixer  
**External Dependencies**: None currently (self-contained web application)  

## Integration Approach

**Hardware Abstraction Strategy**: Create new `src/hardware/` module structure with standardized interfaces for controller communication, independent of existing audio engine  

**MIDI Integration Strategy**: Web MIDI API wrapper with graceful fallback, connection pooling, and automatic reconnection logic that doesn't interfere with existing Tone.js scheduler  

**State Management Strategy**: Extend existing React state patterns with hardware event listeners, ensuring hardware modules subscribe to core sequencer state without tight coupling  

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Hardware module unit tests with MIDI mocking, integration tests with virtual MIDI devices, cross-browser compatibility testing with Web MIDI API detection

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
```
src/hardware/
  ├── core/           # Hardware abstraction layer
  ├── apc40/          # APC40-specific implementation  
  ├── types/          # Hardware module TypeScript interfaces
  └── utils/          # Shared MIDI utilities
```

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for components, maintain existing import/export patterns  
**Coding Standards**: Continue existing TypeScript strict mode, ESLint configuration, component composition over inheritance patterns  
**Documentation Standards**: JSDoc for hardware module APIs, README updates for hardware setup requirements, maintain existing inline comment patterns  

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Hardware modules included in existing Vite build pipeline, no additional build steps required  
**Deployment Strategy**: Static deployment remains unchanged, add HTTPS requirement documentation for Web MIDI API functionality  
**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing console error handling to include hardware connection events and MIDI communication errors  
**Configuration Management**: Hardware settings stored in localStorage following existing settings patterns, no server-side configuration required

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:  
- Web MIDI API browser compatibility (Safari completely unsupported)
- MIDI timing precision may not match audio engine timing accuracy
- Hardware disconnection during performance could disrupt user workflow

**Integration Risks**:  
- Hardware event loops could interfere with existing React rendering cycles  
- MIDI message flooding could impact application performance
- Multiple hardware modules could create state synchronization conflicts

**Deployment Risks**:  
- HTTPS requirement for Web MIDI may complicate local development  
- Different operating systems handle MIDI devices differently
- USB driver issues on user systems outside application control

**Mitigation Strategies**:  
- Browser compatibility detection with clear user messaging and graceful degradation
- Hardware module isolation ensures failures don't crash core application  
- Comprehensive error handling and automatic reconnection for device management
- Local development HTTPS setup documentation and tooling recommendations
