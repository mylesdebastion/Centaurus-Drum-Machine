## Transition Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Haven't Started Either Epic Yet

**Decision**: **Start with Epic 22 immediately**

**Rationale**:
- Epic 22 takes 6-9 hours vs. Epic 21's 103 hours
- Epic 22 is self-sustaining, Epic 21 requires constant effort
- Epic 22 delivers 67-335x more users

**Action Plan**:
1. Week 1: Build Epic 22 stories (6-9 hours)
2. Week 2-4: Seed with 10 users via AI outreach (1.5 hours)
3. Week 5-12: Monitor and optimize (2 hours)
4. **Skip Epic 21 entirely**

---

### Scenario 2: Already Started Epic 21 (Invested <20 hours)

**Decision**: **Pivot to Epic 22, salvage useful work from Epic 21**

**What to keep from Epic 21**:
- ✅ Analytics setup (Story 21.2) - still needed for Epic 22 tracking
- ✅ SEO basics (Story 21.1) - one-time setup, low maintenance
- ✅ Top 10 relationship research - use with AI Outreach Generator

**What to drop from Epic 21**:
- ❌ Daily social media posts - time sink, low ROI
- ❌ 12-week content calendar - replaced by product onboarding
- ❌ Video production - use simple screen recordings instead

**Action Plan**:
1. **Finish** Story 21.2 (Analytics) if not done - needed for Epic 22
2. **Finish** Story 21.1 (SEO basics) if 80%+ complete - sunk cost fallacy otherwise
3. **Start** Epic 22 stories immediately (6-9 hours)
4. **Use** Top 10 relationships with AI Outreach Generator (Story 22.2)

**Example**:
> "I spent 15 hours on Epic 21 (SEO setup + content calendar). I'll finish the SEO setup (3 hours left), skip the content calendar (saved 30 hours), and pivot to Epic 22. Total investment: 18 hours Epic 21 + 9 hours Epic 22 = 27 hours (vs. 103 hours for full Epic 21)."

---

### Scenario 3: Deep into Epic 21 (Invested 20-50 hours)

**Decision**: **Hybrid approach - keep what's working, add Epic 22 viral loops**

**What to keep from Epic 21**:
- ✅ Community engagement that's yielding users (measurable ROI)
- ✅ SEO if ranking for target keywords
- ✅ Email sequences (set-and-forget automation)

**What to add from Epic 22**:
- ✅ Story 22.1 (Multi-Path Onboarding) - turn existing users into advocates
- ✅ Story 22.4 (Viral Loop Triggers) - share prompts after tutorial
- ✅ Story 22.3 (Referral Attribution) - track which users bring others

**Action Plan**:
1. **Measure** Epic 21 ROI: Users acquired per hour invested
2. **Keep** tactics with ROI > 0.5 users/hour
3. **Drop** tactics with ROI < 0.5 users/hour
4. **Add** Epic 22 viral loops (4-6 hours) to multiply existing user base
5. **Monitor** k coefficient (if k > 1, Epic 22 takes over)

**Example**:
> "I spent 35 hours on Epic 21. Reddit engagement brought 15 users (0.43 users/hour). Daily Twitter brought 2 users (0.06 users/hour). I'll drop Twitter, keep Reddit, and add Epic 22 viral loops. If k > 1, Reddit users will bring more users via product, not my manual effort."

---

### Scenario 4: Completed Epic 21 (Invested 60+ hours)

**Decision**: **Add Epic 22 on top, let product take over**

**Why not abandon Epic 21**:
- Sunk cost (you already invested 60+ hours)
- If it's working, don't break it
- Epic 22 doesn't replace organic traffic (SEO), it amplifies it

**How Epic 22 Amplifies Epic 21**:
- Epic 21 brings seed users → Epic 22 viral loops multiply them
- Epic 21 SEO brings organic traffic → Epic 22 converts them better (persona onboarding)
- Epic 21 community advocates → Epic 22 referral codes track their impact

**Action Plan**:
1. **Keep** Epic 21 tactics that are working (don't stop SEO, email, etc.)
2. **Build** Epic 22 stories (6-9 hours)
3. **Measure** viral coefficient (k) after Week 4
4. **If k > 1**: Reduce Epic 21 daily effort by 50% (product is growing itself)
5. **If k < 1**: Keep Epic 21 as user acquisition engine, optimize Epic 22 share prompts

**Example**:
> "I've been doing Epic 21 for 8 weeks. SEO brings 5 users/week, community brings 3 users/week. I'll add Epic 22 viral loops. If each user brings 1.3 new users (k=1.3), my 8 users/week will become 10.4 users/week without extra effort. In 4 weeks, product will be growing faster than my manual marketing."

## Specific Story-by-Story Guidance

### Epic 21 Stories: Keep or Skip?

| Story | Title | Keep? | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 21.1 | Fix Marketing Site Gaps (SEO) | ✅ **KEEP** | One-time setup, passive traffic, low maintenance |
| 21.2 | Install Analytics Tracking | ✅ **KEEP** | Required for Epic 22 persona metrics |
| 21.3 | Content Calendar (12 weeks) | ❌ **SKIP** | 30+ hours ongoing, replaced by product onboarding |
| 21.4 | Social Media Guide | ❌ **SKIP** | Daily grind, low ROI, burnout risk |
| 21.5 | User Interview Script | ⚠️ **OPTIONAL** | Use Story 22.2 AI Async Interview Bot instead (faster) |
| 21.6 | Email Nurture Sequences | ✅ **KEEP** | Set-and-forget automation, complements Epic 22 |
| 21.7 | Demo Video Production | ⚠️ **SIMPLIFIED** | Skip fancy production, use 60-second screen recording |

### Epic 22 Stories: Priority Order

If you only have time for 1-2 Epic 22 stories, prioritize:

1. **Story 22.1** (Multi-Path Onboarding) - **CRITICAL** (highest ROI)
2. **Story 22.4** (Viral Loop Triggers) - **CRITICAL** (enables k > 1)
3. **Story 22.3** (Referral Attribution) - **HIGH** (measurement)
4. **Story 22.2** (AI Outreach Generator) - **MEDIUM** (saves time)
5. **Story 22.5** (Reusable Components) - **MEDIUM** (efficiency)
6. **Story 22.6** (Enterprise Sales) - **MEDIUM** (B2B revenue)
7. **Story 22.7** (Accessibility Audit) - **HIGH** (compliance, market fit)

**Minimum Viable Epic 22**: Stories 22.1 + 22.4 (4-5 hours total)

## Transition Timeline

### Week 1: Build Epic 22 Core

**Goal**: Get product-led growth infrastructure in place

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Story 22.1: Multi-Path Onboarding (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Story 22.4: Viral Loop Triggers (1 hour)
- [ ] Story 22.3: Referral Attribution (1-2 hours)

**Epic 21 Work**: Pause daily social/content, keep SEO/analytics if in progress

---

### Week 2-4: Seed & Measure

**Goal**: Get 10 seed users, measure viral coefficient

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Use Story 22.2 (AI Outreach) to contact 2 targets from Top 10 list
- [ ] Send personalized messages with persona URLs (`?v=e&r=gl7u`)
- [ ] Monitor tutorial completion rates by persona
- [ ] Calculate k coefficient (users brought / seed users)

**Epic 21 Work**: Only continue tactics with proven ROI (>0.5 users/hour)

---

### Week 5-8: Optimize

**Goal**: Double down on best personas, achieve k > 1

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Identify best-performing persona (highest completion, share rate)
- [ ] Shift outreach to best persona communities
- [ ] A/B test share prompts (3 variations)
- [ ] Aim for k ≥ 1.3

**Epic 21 Work**: Reduce daily effort by 50% if k > 1 (product is working)

---

### Week 9-12: Scale

**Goal**: Self-sustaining growth, reduce manual effort to 0

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Monitor weekly user growth (should be exponential)
- [ ] Optimize Enterprise conversion (Story 22.6 if needed)
- [ ] Convert top referrers into advocates (free Pro accounts)
- [ ] Weekly review: 10 min/week

**Epic 21 Work**: Keep SEO/email (passive), drop daily manual work

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: "I'll do both Epic 21 and Epic 22 in parallel"

**Problem**: 103 hours (Epic 21) + 9 hours (Epic 22) = 112 hours total. You'll burn out.

**Solution**: Prioritize Epic 22 (9 hours, self-sustaining), only keep Epic 21 tactics with proven ROI.

---

### Mistake 2: "I've invested 40 hours in Epic 21, I can't stop now"

**Problem**: Sunk cost fallacy. 40 hours is already gone. Question is: next 63 hours on Epic 21 or next 9 hours on Epic 22?

**Solution**: Measure Epic 21 ROI. If < 0.5 users/hour, pivot to Epic 22.

---

### Mistake 3: "Epic 22 is too risky, I'll stick with proven Epic 21 tactics"

**Problem**: Epic 21 tactics are "proven" to be low ROI (0.2-1.0 users/hour). Epic 22 math is sound (k=1.3 → exponential growth).

**Solution**: Epic 22 is lower risk (9 hours vs. 103 hours). If k < 1 after Week 4, you can still fall back to Epic 21.

---

### Mistake 4: "I'll build all 7 Epic 22 stories before launching"

**Problem**: Perfectionism. You only need Stories 22.1 + 22.4 for viral loops (4-5 hours).

**Solution**: Ship minimum viable Epic 22 (Stories 22.1 + 22.4), add others as needed.

## Questions?

### "What if Epic 22 doesn't work (k < 1)?"

**Answer**: You've only invested 9 hours vs. Epic 21's 103 hours. You can:
- Option A: Optimize share prompts (A/B test 3 variations)
- Option B: Fall back to Epic 21 community engagement
- Option C: Hybrid - use Epic 21 to seed, Epic 22 to amplify

**Worst case**: You wasted 9 hours. Epic 21 worst case: 103 hours + burnout.

---

### "Can I do Epic 21 social posts to amplify Epic 22?"

**Answer**: Yes! Social posts can share persona URLs (`jam.audiolux.app?v=e&r=tw12`) to:
- Drive traffic to personalized onboarding
- Track which platforms convert best
- Reduce friction (no account required)

**But**: Don't do daily posts. Do weekly posts with best-performing persona URLs.

---

### "What if I already have users from Epic 21?"

**Answer**: Epic 22 multiplies them! Add Stories 22.1 + 22.4 to existing user base:
- Current users → complete personalized tutorial → share with friends
- Each user brings 1.3 new users (k=1.3)
- 50 Epic 21 users → 115 users in 4 weeks (without you doing anything)
