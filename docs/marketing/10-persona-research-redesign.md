# Persona Research & Design (Redesigned)
## 6 Core Personas with Reusable Journey Components

**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Active
**Version**: 2.0 (Redesigned from original 5 personas)

---

## Design Philosophy

**Problem with v1.0**: "Deaf Musician" combined two separate attributes (hearing status + role), making it too narrow and excluding potential users.

**Solution v2.0**: Separate attributes into distinct personas with **reusable journey components** that combine based on user needs.

**Benefits**:
- More inclusive (Deaf person who doesn't identify as musician yet)
- Efficient (reuse tutorial components across personas)
- Scalable (easy to add new personas or combinations)
- Data-driven (track which combinations convert best)
