2. **Drake Music DMLab** - Apply for community session
3. **Scarlet Watters** (4.4M TikTok) - DM TikTok/Instagram

## 🤖 Why AI-Native Works

**Traditional**: Hustle porn, burn out, quit
**AI-Native**: Tools do grunt work, you add human touch

**Example**:
- **Old way**: Spend 2 hours scrolling Reddit hoping to find opportunities
- **New way**: Signal Detector finds 5 relevant posts, sends Slack alert. You pick best 2, Reply Drafter generates options, you edit + post. **Total time: 15 minutes.**

**You're technical. Use that.**

## ✅ What's Been Built Already

From the workflow assessment (2025-01-24):
- ✅ Studio polished, production-ready
- ✅ SEO optimized (meta tags, sitemap)
- ✅ Vercel Analytics installed
- ✅ Git workflow safeguarded
- ✅ Deployment automated

**You have a great product. You just need 10 people to care.**

---

## 🚫 What You're Deleting from Strategy

Based on your feedback:
- ❌ Daily social media posts (not your strength)
- ❌ Fancy video production (bare minimum only)
- ❌ SEO blog treadmill (do once, move on)
- ❌ Mass promotion tactics (focus on relationships)

**Keep**:
- ✅ One 60-second demo video (reuse forever)
- ✅ 3 GIFs for Reddit posts (made from video)
- ✅ SEO basics (Story 21.1, takes 1 hour with AI)
- ✅ Analytics (Story 21.2, need data)

---

## 💡 Key Mindset

**"I need 1,000 followers"** → **"I need 10 advocates"**

If Sean Forbes (D-PAN, 59K followers) tweets about Audiolux → you get 50 users.
If Scarlet Watters (4.4M TikTok) mentions it → you get 500 users.

**One relationship > 1,000 posts**

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Read**: `08-ai-native-strategy.md` (10 min)
2. **Read**: `../audiolux-community-research-2025.md` (10 min)
3. **Print**: Top 10 Relationships list (above)
4. **Build**: Tool 1 - Community Signal Detector (Monday, 6-8 hours)

---

## 🎉 Why This Will Work

1. **Market gap is real** - No visual-first DAW for Deaf/HOH
2. **Community is tight-knit** - 1 advocate brings 10 users
3. **You're technical** - Can build AI tools competitors can't
4. **You're genuine** - Not a corporation, users reach the creator
5. **You're early** - Greenfield market

**This is winnable. Not with hustle porn, but with relationships + AI.**
