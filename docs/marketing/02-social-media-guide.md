**Thought Leadership**:
```
The music production industry has a massive accessibility gap.

Traditional DAWs assume you can hear. But what if you're Deaf or hard-of-hearing?

That's why we built Audiolux—the first visual-first music studio.

Here's what we learned building for an underserved community:

1. [Insight #1]
2. [Insight #2]
3. [Insight #3]

[Screenshot or data visualization]

What other industries need this kind of rethinking?
```

**Building in Public**:
```
90 days ago, I launched Audiolux with zero users.

Today: 100+ musicians creating daily.

Here's what worked (and what didn't):

✅ What worked:
- Reddit outreach to r/deaf community
- Building in public on Twitter
- Free tier with generous limits

❌ What didn't:
- Paid ads before product-market fit
- Over-engineered onboarding
- Ignoring mobile users

Biggest lesson: [Key takeaway]

[Metrics screenshot]

#StartupJourney #BuildInPublic #MusicTech
```

**Education Focus**:
```
Just wrapped a pilot program with 3 music teachers, 90 students.

The results? 100% said visual music creation helped them understand theory faster.

Here's what one teacher shared:

Happy to answer any questions!
```

**Accessibility Angle** (r/deaf):
```
Title: "I built a visual music studio for Deaf musicians - would love your feedback"

Body:
Hi r/deaf community,

I'm a hearing developer who built a music creation tool specifically designed to work *without* sound.

**The problem I'm trying to solve:**
Traditional DAWs (music software) assume you can hear. But music is patterns, rhythm, and theory - all visual concepts.

**What Audiolux does differently:**
- 🎨 Color-coded notes and chords
- 📊 Visual rhythm patterns (no audio waveforms needed)
- 🎹 See harmonies, not just hear them
- 👥 Collaborate with Deaf and hearing musicians together

[Screenshot showing colorful interface]

**I need your help:**
- Is this actually useful or am I missing the mark?
- What would make it better for the Deaf community?
- Would you use this, or know someone who would?

**Try it**: jam.audiolux.app (100% free, built as a community tool)

Full disclosure: I'm not Deaf, so I may have blind spots. Your honest feedback (positive or critical) is invaluable.

Thank you for your time!
```

**Technical Deep-Dive** (r/webdev):
```
Title: "Built a real-time collaborative DAW with React, Vite, and WebRTC - here's what I learned"

Body:
Hey r/webdev!

Just shipped Audiolux, a browser-based music production studio with real-time collaboration. Thought I'd share some technical learnings:

**The Stack:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- Tone.js (Web Audio API wrapper)
- WebRTC (P2P audio sync)
- Tailwind CSS

**Biggest challenges:**
1. **Audio latency**: [How we solved it - 2-3 sentences]
2. **State sync across clients**: [Our approach]
3. **Performance with multiple audio nodes**: [Optimization strategy]

[Code snippet or architecture diagram if relevant]

**Live demo**: jam.audiolux.app

**Open questions:**

- Best practices for Web Audio performance?

Happy to dive deeper into any aspect. GitHub: [link if open source]
