## ❌ Blocked - Awaiting Features

### Producer (p)
- **Status**: ❌ BLOCKED (until Epic 24)
- **Missing Features**:
  - ❌ MIDI/WAV export functionality (critical)
  - ❌ Advanced modules (synths, effects, samplers)
  - ❌ Automation
  - ❌ Latency/audio quality specs not documented
- **Blocking Epic**: **Epic 24 - Producer Export Feature**
- **When Ready**: After MIDI/WAV export is implemented
- **Why Blocked**: Producer persona requires export to validate as "professional tool" not "browser toy"

**User Feedback (from QA review)**:
> "Can I export MIDI/WAV? If not, this is useless to me. Why isn't export mentioned anywhere?"

**Estimated Epic 24 Effort**: 6-8 hours
- MIDI export implementation
- WAV export (stems)
- Project download
- Desktop DAW integration docs

### Enterprise/Institution (i)
- **Status**: ❌ BLOCKED (until Epic 25)
- **Missing Features**:
  - ❌ Admin dashboard
  - ❌ Multi-seat licensing
  - ❌ Usage analytics
  - ❌ Team management
  - ❌ B2B pricing tiers ($199-$999 don't exist)
- **Blocking Epic**: **Epic 25 - Admin Dashboard & B2B Infrastructure**
- **When Ready**: After admin dashboard and licensing system built
- **Why Blocked**: Can't sell $199-$999 licenses without infrastructure

**User Feedback (from Epic 23 assessment)**:
> "No one is paying $199 for a basic visualizer (at least what we're showing in onboarding)"

**Estimated Epic 25 Effort**: 8-12 hours
- Admin dashboard (seat management, analytics)
- Stripe integration for annual subscriptions
- Multi-seat licensing system
- Email invitation system
- Usage analytics tracking

- **Features Available**:

- **Missing Validation**:
  - ❌ No WCAG compliance testing
  - ❌ No testing with actual Deaf users
  - ❌ Accessibility audit not performed
- **Blocking**: **User testing + Epic 26 (Accessibility Compliance)**
- **When Ready**: After testing with Deaf users validates experience
- **Why Blocked**: Can't market as "accessible" without validation

**Estimated Epic 26 Effort**: 3-4 hours
- WCAG 2.1 compliance audit
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation improvements
- Testing with Deaf community

## Honest Assessment (From Epic 23 Course Correction)

**What We Learned**:
- Original Epic 22 oversold features we don't have
- Producer/Enterprise personas market vaporware
- QA reviews exposed feature gaps
- Onboarding was sparse and disconnected from actual product

**What We Fixed (Epic 23)**:
- Only show ready personas (3 instead of 6)
- Route to actual Studio (not separate tutorial)
- Preset system + gradual reveal (learns real interface)
- Removed blocked personas until features exist

**Result**: Honest, scalable onboarding that doesn't oversell.
