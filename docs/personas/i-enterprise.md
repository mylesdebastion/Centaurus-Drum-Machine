3. **Pilot Evaluation** (Week 3-4): Test with 10-30 students (free trial)
4. **Budget Request** (Week 5): Submit to board/department head
5. **Board Approval** (Week 6-8): Approval process (varies by institution)

**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks from discovery to paid license

## Key Sales Objections & Responses

### "We already use GarageBand/Ableton"

### "Our IT department won't approve new software"
- **Response**: "Browser-based means no installation, no IT approval needed. Students access via URL, just like Google Classroom."

### "Is this accessible for Deaf/HOH students?"
- **Response**: "Yes. Color-coded notes, visual feedback, waveform visualizer. Designed with input from Deaf musicians and educators."

### "What if we need support?"
- **Response**: "Enterprise licenses include dedicated support, onboarding training, and teacher resources. We'll help you get started and troubleshoot any issues."

## ROI Calculation (30-student classroom)

**Traditional DAW (Ableton)**:
- Cost: $200/seat × 30 students = $6,000

**Audiolux (Classroom License)**:
- Cost: $199/year ($6.60/student/year)
- IT setup: 0 weeks (browser-based)
- Accessibility: Full (visual-first design)

**Savings: $5,801/year (97% cost reduction)**
