# Persona: Visual Learner (`v`)

**Code**: `v`
**URL Parameter**: `?v=v`
**Budget**: Free tier or $10/mo Pro
**Example URL**: jam.audiolux.app?v=v&r=dr3m

## Who They Are

- People who learn best by seeing patterns (not necessarily musicians)
- May have ADHD, dyslexia, or just prefer visual thinking
- Intimidated by traditional sheet music

## Demographics

- **Age**: 12-35
- **Learning style**: Visual/spatial (not auditory)
- **Budget**: Free tier or $10/mo Pro
- **Platforms**: Reddit (r/learnmusic, r/musictheory), YouTube tutorials

## Pain Points

- Traditional music notation is confusing ("I can't read sheet music")
- Audio-first tutorials don't work ("I need to SEE it to understand")
- "I want to learn music theory but books/videos don't click for me"

## Goals

- Learn music theory by seeing patterns
- Create music without traditional notation
- Understand chord progressions visually

## User Journey

**Tutorial**: Visual Theory + Color Sequencer

1. **Hook** (3 sec): "Music for visual thinkers. No sheet music needed."
2. **Visual Patterns** (20 sec):
   - "The grid is rhythm. Light boxes = beats."
   - Create kick drum pattern (see pattern visually)
3. **Color = Pitch** (15 sec):
   - "Colors show pitch relationships"
   - Load Chord Builder, click C Major
   - See colors light up (red, yellow, blue = C, E, G)
4. **Celebration** (5 sec):
   - "You just learned music theory visually üëÅÔ∏è"
   - Share prompt: "Share with other visual learners"

## Messaging

- **Headline**: "Music production for visual thinkers"
- **Subhead**: "See patterns, not notation. Learn theory through color."
- **CTA**: "Start creating (free)"

## Success Metrics

- 65%+ tutorial completion
- 35%+ explore Chord Builder after tutorial (theory interest)
- 20%+ return to create second project

## Outreach Targets

- **Reddit**: r/musictheory, r/learnmusic, r/ADHD (music learners)
- **YouTube**: Visual music theory channels
- **Discord**: Music learning communities

## Tutorial Modules Used

- Visual Music Theory (15-20s)
- Color Sequencer (15s)

## Specific Needs Addressed

‚úÖ Grid-based sequencer (no sheet music)
‚úÖ Color-coded pitch (visual theory)
‚úÖ Pattern recognition (see chord progressions)
‚úÖ No musical background required
‚úÖ ADHD-friendly (visual focus, immediate feedback)

## Language Preferences

**YES**: "See the pattern, visual grid, colors show pitch, learn by seeing"
**NO**: "Read the notation, music theory (traditional), sheet music, staff notation"

## Bailout Triggers

- Traditional music notation appears
- Text-heavy explanations
- Audio-only instructions
- Assumes prior music knowledge

## What Makes Them Trust Us

- Immediate visual representation (grid, colors)
- No notation required (removes intimidation)
- Pattern-based learning (matches cognitive style)
- ADHD-friendly design (visual focus, quick feedback)

## What Makes Them Convert (Free ‚Üí Pro)

- Want to explore more modules (synths, effects)
- Hit project limit (3 projects in Free tier)
- Discover music theory through experimentation
- Share creations with friends/communities

## Learning Pathways

**Typical progression**:
1. Start with drum sequencer (rhythm patterns)
2. Discover Chord Builder (pitch/color relationships)
3. Combine rhythm + melody (full song)
4. Explore music theory (scales, progressions)
5. Share with visual learning communities

**Theory learning happens through experimentation**, not traditional study.

## ADHD-Specific Features

- **Visual focus**: Grid-based, color-coded (reduces auditory overwhelm)
- **Immediate feedback**: Click = sound + visual change
- **Chunked learning**: 5-10 second tutorial steps
- **No long text**: Visual instructions only
- **Hyperfocus-friendly**: Can explore patterns for hours
