   - Position 5 ‚Üí Blue Boomwhacker
   - Position 6 ‚Üí Purple Boomwhacker

### Instructions (via interpreter)
1. ‚úÖ **"Watch your tube. When it lights up, hit your Boomwhacker"**
2. ‚úÖ Demonstrate first: Stand at Position 1, watch tube, hit on beat
3. ‚úÖ Let students practice individually (turn on only 1 lane at a time)
4. ‚úÖ Start pattern, all students play together

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Tube Not Lighting
**Symptoms:** Tube powered on but not responding to pattern

**Solutions (try in order):**
1. ‚úÖ Check tube WiFi indicator (green = connected)
2. ‚úÖ Check LEDStripManager UI (tube should show "Connected")
3. ‚úÖ Restart tube (unplug power, wait 5 seconds, replug)
4. ‚úÖ Check IP address matches config (see tube label)
5. ‚úÖ **If still failing:** Click "Disable" in LEDStripManager, continue with 5 tubes

### Problem: Sound Not Playing
**Symptoms:** Pattern running but no audio

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check laptop volume (set to 70%+)
2. ‚úÖ Click Play/Pause button to restart audio engine
3. ‚úÖ Refresh browser page (F5 or Cmd+R)
4. ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

### Problem: WebSocket Bridge Crashed
**Symptoms:** Message "WebSocket disconnected" or tubes stop responding

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Close terminal window running bridge
2. ‚úÖ Re-run startup script: `./education/workshop-start.sh`
3. ‚úÖ Refresh browser page
4. ‚úÖ Wait 10 seconds for tubes to reconnect

### Problem: Laptop WiFi Disconnected
**Symptoms:** All tubes show "Disconnected" status

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check laptop WiFi icon (ensure connected to correct network)
2. ‚úÖ Reconnect to WiFi
3. ‚úÖ Wait 30 seconds for tubes to auto-reconnect
4. ‚úÖ **Backup:** Use phone hotspot, reconnect laptop + tubes to hotspot

### Problem: Sequencer Not Responding
**Symptoms:** Can't click buttons, pattern won't start

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Refresh browser page (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. ‚úÖ Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
3. ‚úÖ Restart entire setup (close terminal, re-run startup script)

## üö® EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN

### If ALL Tech Fails (Worst Case Scenario)

**Option 1: Visual-Only Mode (No LEDs)**
1. Show students laptop screen with color-coded sequencer
2. Point to screen colors as pattern plays
3. Students watch screen, hit Boomwhackers when they see their color
4. Less engaging, but functional

**Option 2: Instructor-Led Call & Response**
1. Instructor calls out colors: **"Red! Orange! Yellow!"**
2. Students hit corresponding Boomwhacker on cue
3. Gradually speed up tempo
4. Students learn rhythm through verbal cues

**Option 3: Paper Activity (No Technology)**
1. Use pre-printed rhythm notation sheets
2. Color-code notes with markers (match Boomwhacker colors)
3. Students read paper, play rhythm together
4. Instructor taps tempo on desk

**Option 4: Pre-Recorded Video**
1. Show pre-recorded video of working WLED setup
2. Explain concept visually
3. Let students try Boomwhackers without LED feedback
4. Focus on feel/timing instead of visual cues
