# Epic 1: APC40 Hardware Controller Integration

**Epic Goal**: Enable professional hardware control of the Centaurus Drum Machine through APC40 MIDI controller integration with real-time LED feedback, while establishing a modular hardware abstraction layer for future controller expansion.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Maintain complete compatibility with existing web-based functionality
- Implement hardware abstraction layer suitable for multiple controller types
- Ensure graceful degradation when hardware is unavailable or unsupported  
- Provide seamless user experience bridging physical hardware and web interface

## Story 1.1: Hardware Abstraction Layer Foundation

As a **system architect**,  
I want **a modular hardware abstraction layer**,  
so that **multiple MIDI controllers can interface with the core sequencer without tight coupling**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Create `src/hardware/core/` module with standardized controller interfaces  
2. Implement event-driven communication system for hardware ↔ sequencer interaction
3. Design controller lifecycle management (connect/disconnect/error handling)  
4. Establish plugin architecture for future hardware module additions
5. Create TypeScript interfaces defining hardware module contracts

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Existing sequencer functionality remains completely unchanged and operational
- **IV2**: Core sequencer operates normally when no hardware modules are connected  
- **IV3**: Performance benchmarks show <5% overhead from abstraction layer

## Story 1.2: Web MIDI API Integration and Browser Compatibility

As a **web application user**,  
I want **reliable MIDI device connection with proper browser compatibility detection**,  
so that **I can use hardware controllers when supported and receive clear guidance when not**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Implement Web MIDI API wrapper with automatic device detection
2. Create browser compatibility detection for Web MIDI API support
3. Implement graceful degradation messaging for Safari and unsupported browsers  
4. Build connection status indicators and error handling UI
5. Add HTTPS development setup documentation for Web MIDI requirements

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Application loads and functions normally on all browsers including Safari
- **IV2**: MIDI connection errors do not crash the application or lose sequencer state  
- **IV3**: Clear user messaging explains hardware requirements and limitations

## Story 1.3: APC40 Device Integration and MIDI Implementation

As a **music producer**,  
I want **my APC40 controller to connect and communicate with the drum sequencer**,  
so that **I can control patterns using physical hardware buttons**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Implement APC40-specific MIDI mapping for 8x5 grid to 16-step sequencer  
2. Create APC40 device initialization with SysEx mode switching  
3. Build bidirectional communication (hardware buttons ↔ sequencer state)
4. Implement APC40 reconnection logic and error recovery
5. Create APC40 module following hardware abstraction layer interfaces

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Web interface continues to function identically whether APC40 is connected or not
- **IV2**: APC40 connection/disconnection does not affect existing sequencer timing or audio
- **IV3**: Hardware button presses and web UI interactions both update the same core sequencer state

## Story 1.4: Real-time LED Feedback and Visual Synchronization

As a **music producer using APC40**,  
I want **LED feedback that shows my pattern state and playback position**,  
so that **I can see my rhythm patterns and current playback position on the hardware**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Implement LED color mapping for step states (off/velocity-based/current position)
2. Synchronize LED updates with existing Tone.js playback timing  
3. Create LED animation system for playback position indication
4. Optimize LED update performance to maintain <50ms latency
5. Handle LED state synchronization when sequencer state changes from any source

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Existing audio playback timing and performance remain unchanged
- **IV2**: LED updates do not cause audio dropouts or timing drift  
- **IV3**: Visual feedback stays synchronized between hardware LEDs and web interface

## Story 1.5: Multi-Hardware Coordination and State Management

As a **advanced producer**,  
I want **multiple hardware controllers to work together seamlessly**,  
so that **I can use different controllers for specialized functions in complex setups**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Enable multiple hardware modules to connect simultaneously
2. Implement inter-module event communication for coordinated behaviors  
3. Create hardware module priority and conflict resolution system
4. Build hot-swap capability for connecting/disconnecting devices during operation
5. Implement state synchronization across all connected hardware and web interface

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Core sequencer performance remains stable with multiple hardware modules
- **IV2**: Disconnecting one hardware module does not affect others or core functionality
- **IV3**: State changes from any source (hardware A, hardware B, web UI) sync to all interfaces

## Story 1.6: Hardware Management UI and Settings Integration

As a **user with APC40 hardware**,  
I want **intuitive settings and status information for my hardware**,  
so that **I can configure my hardware and understand its connection status**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Add hardware status indicators to main interface following existing design patterns
2. Create APC40 settings panel integrated with existing settings modal  
3. Implement LED brightness and color mode controls specific to APC40
4. Build hardware module manager for multi-device scenarios
5. Maintain responsive behavior and accessibility standards for all hardware UI

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Existing settings and UI layouts remain unchanged and functional  
- **IV2**: Hardware UI elements follow existing Tailwind CSS patterns and component architecture
- **IV3**: Mobile responsiveness maintained with hardware features gracefully adapted
