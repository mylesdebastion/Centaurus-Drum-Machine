# Epic 12: Sound Engine Expansion

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Priority:** Medium
**Target Completion:** Q4 2024 (Completed: 2025-10-11)

---

## Epic Overview

Expand the sound palette available in Isometric Sequencer and Piano Roll with high-quality instrument sound engines beyond the default synthesizer. This epic adds four production-ready sound engines (Acoustic Guitar, Fender Rhodes, FM Bell, 808 Drums) using Tone.js synthesis and sampling techniques, providing musicians with diverse tonal options for composition and performance.

**Vision:** Transform the Centaurus Drum Machine from a single-synth sequencer into a multi-timbral workstation where users can select the perfect sound for their musical idea—from warm acoustic guitar to punchy 808 drums to shimmering FM bells.

**Business Requirements:**
- Increase user engagement through sound variety
- Appeal to diverse musical genres (jazz, hip-hop, ambient, electronic)
- Differentiate from basic drum machines with professional sound quality
- Enable genre-specific workflows (lo-fi hip-hop with Rhodes, ambient with guitar + reverb)
- Reduce "demo fatigue" by providing multiple sonic palettes

**Technical Requirements:**
- Unified sound engine architecture in `src/utils/soundEngines.ts`
- Tone.js-based synthesis and sampling (no external audio files needed)
- Consistent API: `triggerAttack(note, velocity)`, `triggerRelease(note)`
- Memory-efficient loading (lazy initialization)
- Effects integration (reverb, chorus, distortion)
- Dropdown selector UI in Isometric Sequencer and Piano Roll

---

## Core Philosophy

### Unified Sound Engine Architecture

All sound engines follow a consistent factory pattern:

```typescript
interface SoundEngine {
  triggerAttack(note: string, time?: number, velocity?: number): void;
  triggerRelease(note: string, time?: number): void;
  dispose(): void;
}

type SoundEngineType = 'synth' | 'guitar' | 'rhodes' | 'bell' | 'drums';

function createSoundEngine(type: SoundEngineType): SoundEngine {
  // Factory creates appropriate engine
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Drop-in replacement (change engine type, everything else stays the same)
- Easy testing and iteration
- Consistent UX across all instruments
- Simplified maintenance (one file, one pattern)

### Tone.js Native Implementation

**No external dependencies beyond Tone.js:**
- Sampler instruments use tonejs-instruments URLs (CDN-hosted)
- Synthesizers use Tone.js built-in oscillators and effects
- Effects (reverb, chorus, distortion) from Tone.js library
- Web Audio API underneath (low latency, high performance)

### Progressive Enhancement

Sound engines are **optional enhancements**. Default synth always available as fallback:
- App works without any sound engine selected
- Engines loaded lazily (only when selected)
- Graceful degradation if CDN unavailable (Sampler fallback)
- No breaking changes to existing code

## Reference Implementations

### Acoustic Guitar (GuitarFretboard)
- **Location:** `src/components/GuitarFretboard/GuitarFretboard.tsx`
- **Proven features:**
  - Tone.Sampler with real acoustic guitar samples (11 notes, A2-C5)
  - Reverb effect (decay: 1.8, wet: 0.25) for spatial depth
  - Natural release: 1 second
  - Volume: -4dB for balanced mix
  - **Successfully used in production** → Extracted to sound engine

### 808 Drums (JamSession)
- **Location:** `src/components/JamSession/JamSession.tsx`
- **Proven features:**
  - Tone.MembraneSynth for kick drum (pitch envelope, octaves: 10)
  - Tone.NoiseSynth for snare (pink noise, envelope decay: 0.15)
  - Tone.MetalSynth for hi-hat (resonance: 4000, octaves: 1.5)
  - Velocity dynamics for punchy, expressive sound
  - **Successfully used in production** → Extracted to sound engine

    this.reverb = new Tone.Reverb({
      decay: 1.8,
      wet: 0.25
    }).toDestination();

    // Load acoustic guitar samples from tonejs-instruments CDN
    this.sampler = new Tone.Sampler({
      urls: {
        A2: "A2.mp3",

```typescript
class BellSoundEngine implements SoundEngine {
  private synth: Tone.PolySynth;

  constructor() {
    this.synth = new Tone.PolySynth(Tone.FMSynth, {
      harmonicity: 8,          // High harmonicity for bell-like timbre
      modulationIndex: 4,       // Enhanced modulation for distinct character
      oscillator: {
        type: "sine"
      },
      envelope: {
        attack: 0.001,         // Fast attack (percussive)
        decay: 2,              // Long decay (shimmer)
        sustain: 0.1,
        release: 2
      },
      modulation: {
        type: "sine"
      },
      modulationEnvelope: {
        attack: 0.002,
        decay: 0.2,
        sustain: 0,
        release: 0.2
      },
      volume: -8
    }).toDestination();
  }

  // ... triggerAttack, triggerRelease, dispose
}
```

### 808 Drums Engine

```typescript
class DrumsSoundEngine implements SoundEngine {
  private kick: Tone.MembraneSynth;
  private snare: Tone.NoiseSynth;
  private hihat: Tone.MetalSynth;

  constructor() {
    // Kick drum (808-style)
    this.kick = new Tone.MembraneSynth({
      pitchDecay: 0.05,
      octaves: 10,
      oscillator: { type: "sine" },
      envelope: {
        attack: 0.001,
        decay: 0.4,
        sustain: 0.01,
        release: 1.4
      },
      volume: -6
    }).toDestination();

    // Snare drum
    this.snare = new Tone.NoiseSynth({
      noise: { type: "pink" },
      envelope: {
        attack: 0.001,
        decay: 0.15,
        sustain: 0
      },
      volume: -8
    }).toDestination();

    // Hi-hat
    this.hihat = new Tone.MetalSynth({
      frequency: 200,
      envelope: {
        attack: 0.001,
        decay: 0.1,
        release: 0.01
      },
      harmonicity: 5.1,
      modulationIndex: 32,
      resonance: 4000,
      octaves: 1.5,
      volume: -12
    }).toDestination();
  }

  triggerAttack(note: string, time?: number, velocity: number = 1): void {
    const midiNote = Tone.Frequency(note).toMidi();

    // Velocity dynamics (be064e8)
    const kickVelocity = velocity * 1.2;
    const snareVelocity = velocity * 1.1;
    const hihatVelocity = velocity * 0.9;

    // Map MIDI notes to drum sounds
    if (midiNote < 40) {
      this.kick.triggerAttackRelease("C1", "8n", time, kickVelocity);
    } else if (midiNote < 60) {
      this.snare.triggerAttackRelease("8n", time, snareVelocity);
    } else {
      this.hihat.triggerAttackRelease("32n", time, hihatVelocity);
    }
  }

  // ... triggerRelease (no-op for drums), dispose
}
```

### UI Integration Pattern

```typescript
// In IsometricSequencer.tsx or PianoRoll.tsx
const [soundEngineType, setSoundEngineType] = useState<SoundEngineType>('synth');
const [soundEngine, setSoundEngine] = useState<SoundEngine | null>(null);

// Initialize sound engine
useEffect(() => {
  const engine = createSoundEngine(soundEngineType);
  setSoundEngine(engine);

  return () => {
    engine.dispose();
  };
}, [soundEngineType]);

// Dropdown selector
<select
  value={soundEngineType}
  onChange={(e) => setSoundEngineType(e.target.value as SoundEngineType)}
  className="px-3 py-2 bg-gray-700 rounded-lg"
>
  {Object.entries(SOUND_ENGINE_DISPLAY_NAMES).map(([value, label]) => (
    <option key={value} value={value}>{label}</option>
  ))}
</select>

// Play notes
soundEngine?.triggerAttack(note, time, velocity);
soundEngine?.triggerRelease(note, time);
```
