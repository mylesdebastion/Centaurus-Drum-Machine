# Epic 13: Documentation Infrastructure & Reconciliation

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Priority:** High
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-13

---

## Epic Overview

This epic addresses the technical debt accumulated from rapid prototyping and establishes sustainable documentation practices for the Centaurus Drum Machine project. The work transforms brownfield documentation (scattered, outdated, incomplete) into greenfield structure (organized, current, comprehensive) following the BMad framework.

**Vision:** Create a self-maintaining documentation system that enables AI agents and human developers to understand project status, find implementation details, and contribute effectively without tribal knowledge dependencies.

**Business Requirements:**
- Development velocity blocked by documentation gaps (73% of Dev Agent Records incomplete)
- New contributors cannot onboard effectively (no single source of truth)
- Project management requires manual status tracking (11 stories with outdated statuses)
- Historical implementation details lost (10+ orphan features undocumented)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Comprehensive templates for epics, stories, and maintenance workflows
- Git-commit-based Dev Agent Record backfill procedures
- Consolidated epic location (migrate from dual structure: docs/prd/ and docs/epics/)
- Architecture documentation reflecting current component structure

---

## Core Philosophy

### Documentation as Code
Documentation is treated as a first-class deliverable with version control, review processes, and quality standards equivalent to code. Templates and guidelines ensure consistency across all documentation artifacts.

### Git as Single Source of Truth
Implementation details are derived from git history rather than memory. Dev Agent Records are populated using `git show`, `git diff`, and `git log` commands to ensure accuracy and completeness.

### Progressive Enhancement Over Big-Bang Rewrites
Rather than rewriting all documentation at once, this epic establishes patterns and systematically backfills high-priority gaps (Epic 4-12) while deferring lower-priority items to future maintenance cycles.

---

## Reference Implementations

### Phase 1 Audit: Reconciliation Audit
- **Location:** `docs/reconciliation-audit.md`
- **Proven findings:**
  - Only 1 epic documented (Epic 9) despite 4-5 feature families implemented
  - 11 stories with outdated statuses (Draft/PLANNING but code complete)
  - 73% of Dev Agent Records incomplete (8 of 11 stories missing implementation details)
  - 12 components (63%) undocumented in architecture docs
  - Dual epic location causing confusion (docs/prd/ vs docs/epics/)

### Phase 2 Standards: Documentation Templates
- **Location:** `docs/templates/`
- **Deliverables:**
  - `documentation-standards.md` (650 lines) - Single source of truth for all conventions
  - `epic-template.md` (250 lines) - Based on Epic 9 structure
  - `story-template.md` (450 lines) - Comprehensive template with detailed Dev Agent Record section
  - `prd-consolidation-plan.md` (350 lines) - Step-by-step migration plan
  - `documentation-maintenance-guidelines.md` (600 lines) - Daily/weekly/monthly workflows

### **Story 13.2: Brownfield Documentation Reconciliation** ✅ **HIGH**
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-13
**Complexity:** High
**Prerequisites:** Story 13.1 (templates must exist)

- Update architecture docs with 12 missing components

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/reconciliation-audit.md` (700 lines) - Phase 1 findings
- `docs/phase-3-execution-progress.md` (250 lines) - Checkpoint for resumability
- Modified: `docs/stories/4.1.story.md` through `docs/stories/4.7.story.md` (COMPLETE status + Dev Agent Records)
- Modified: `docs/stories/5.1.story.md`, `6.1.story.md`, `9.1.story.md`, `9.2.story.md` (COMPLETE status only)
- Created: `docs/epics/epic-5-universal-responsive-architecture.md`
- Created: `docs/epics/epic-6-multi-client-sessions-wled.md`
- Created: `docs/epics/epic-11-roli-lumi-integration.md`
- Created: `docs/epics/epic-12-sound-engine-expansion.md`
- Modified: `docs/prd/index.md` (references epics, doesn't contain them)
- Created: `docs/epics/index.md` (consolidated epic listing)
- Modified: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` (add 12 missing components)

**Reuse:**
- ✅ Git history for Dev Agent Record backfill (git show, git diff, git log)
- ✅ Story content for epic creation
- ✅ Epic template (from Story 13.1)

### Dev Agent Record Backfill Workflow

```typescript
// Git-based backfill procedure (from documentation-maintenance-guidelines.md)

// Step 1: Identify commit(s) that implemented the story
git log --grep="Story 4.2" --oneline
// Output: dbe6539 feat: implement Epic 4 Stories 4.1-4.7

// Step 2: Review commit details
git show dbe6539 --stat
// Shows: files changed, line counts, commit message

// Step 3: Get file-specific line counts
git diff --name-status dbe6539^..dbe6539
wc -l src/components/GlobalMusicHeader/GlobalMusicHeader.tsx
// Output: 466 lines

// Step 4: Populate Dev Agent Record
// Agent Model Used: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
// Completion Notes List: [extracted from commit message]
// File List: [extracted from git diff + wc -l]
```

### Epic Creation Workflow

```typescript
// Workflow for creating missing epics from stories/commits

// Step 1: Read story file
const story = readFile('docs/stories/5.1.story.md');

// Step 2: Extract key information
const storyTitle = "Universal Mobile-Responsive Architecture";
const storyGoal = story.acceptanceCriteria;
const implementation = git show b0d9791;

// Step 3: Populate epic template
const epic = {
  number: 5,
  name: "Universal Responsive Architecture",
  status: "COMPLETE", // If story is complete
  stories: [
    {
      number: "5.1",
      status: "COMPLETE",
      deliverables: implementation.files
    }
  ],
  technicalArchitecture: story.devNotes,
  successMetrics: story.successCriteria
};

// Step 4: Write epic file
writeFile('docs/epics/epic-5-universal-responsive-architecture.md', epic);
```
