## Dependencies

### Critical Path Items (Blockers)
1. **Marketing Site Fixes** (Week 1) - FAQ answers, demo video, screenshots
2. **GA4 Installation** (Week 1) - Can't measure success without analytics
3. **Social Media Assets** (Week 1) - og-image, twitter-card, GIFs for posts
4. **Demo Video Creation** (Week 1) - Required for marketing site, YouTube, social media

### Nice-to-Have (Non-Blocking)

- VST/AU plugins (can defer 12+ months)
- API contracts (can defer for user acquisition focus)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low User Engagement
**Risk**: Users sign up but don't activate (create first project)
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High (acquisition wasted if no activation)
**Mitigation**:
- Onboarding tutorial (interactive walkthrough)
- Template projects (start from example)
- Welcome email series (guide users to first value)
- Track activation funnel (identify drop-off points)

### Risk 2: Negative Accessibility Community Feedback
**Risk**: Deaf community perceives Audiolux as exploitation vs. genuine support
**Probability**: Low (if we're authentic)
**Impact**: Critical (kills credibility)
**Mitigation**:
- Authentic outreach (not sales pitch)
- Hire Deaf consultant for product feedback
- Donate 1% revenue to NAD or accessibility orgs
- Build in public, transparent about mission

### Risk 3: Competitor Response
**Risk**: BandLab or Soundtrap copies accessibility features
**Probability**: Low (not their focus)
**Impact**: Medium (we have 12-month head start)
**Mitigation**:
- Move fast (ship features every 2 weeks)
- Build community moat (100+ loyal users = hard to displace)
- Establish thought leadership (become *the* brand for accessible music)

### Risk 4: Paid Ads Don't Work
**Risk**: CPA > $10, making paid acquisition unprofitable
**Probability**: Medium (common for early-stage products)
**Impact**: Medium (limits growth, but organic still works)
**Mitigation**:
- Test with small budget first ($500 total, Week 7)
- Kill underperforming channels after 7 days
- A/B test creatives (3 variants per channel)
- Focus on organic if paid doesn't work

### Risk 5: Monetization Kills Growth
**Risk**: Paywall too restrictive, users churn to free alternatives
**Probability**: Low (generous free tier)
**Impact**: High (limits revenue)
**Mitigation**:
- Generous free tier (always free, 3 projects)
- Delay Pro push until user is engaged (30 days)
- Survey users on pricing (what feels fair?)
- Founding Member offer for early adopters ($49 lifetime)
