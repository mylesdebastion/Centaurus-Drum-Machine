## Phase 2 Deliverables

### 1. Documentation Standards Document ✅
**File:** `docs/templates/documentation-standards.md`
**Lines:** 650+
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all documentation structure and conventions

**Key Contents:**
- Directory organization (prd, epics, stories, architecture, templates)
- Epic documentation standards (location, structure, status values)
- Story documentation standards (mandatory sections, Dev Agent Record requirements)
- PRD vs Epic relationship (Option A: consolidated to docs/epics/)
- File naming conventions (epic, story, component patterns)
- Completion criteria (story and epic checklists)
- Git commit standards (feat:, docs:, story references)
- Templates usage guide
- Success metrics and KPIs

**Impact:**
- Establishes greenfield documentation structure for entire project
- Resolves brownfield inconsistencies (dual epic locations)
- Defines mandatory Dev Agent Record format (solves 73% incompletion problem)

---

### 2. Epic Template ✅
**File:** `docs/templates/epic-template.md`
**Lines:** 250+
**Purpose:** Standardized template for creating new epics

**Key Sections:**
- Header (Status, Priority, Target Completion)
- Epic Overview (Vision, Business Requirements, Technical Requirements)
- Core Philosophy (optional design principles)
- Reference Implementations (optional proof-of-concepts)
- Stories (with status, complexity, prerequisites)
- Component Reuse Strategy (shared infrastructure vs module-specific)
- Technical Architecture (code examples, data flow)
- Integration Strategy (phased rollout)
- Success Metrics (measurable criteria)
- Future Enhancements (post-MVP ideas)
- Change Log (version history)
- Next Steps (action items)

**Based On:** Epic 9 structure (well-formed example)

**Usage:**
```bash
cp docs/templates/epic-template.md docs/epics/epic-13-new-feature.md
# Edit, replace {PLACEHOLDERS}, delete optional sections
```

---

### 3. Story Template ✅
**File:** `docs/templates/story-template.md`
**Lines:** 450+
**Purpose:** Standardized template for creating new stories

**Key Sections:**
- Title and Status
- Story (As a / I want / So that format)
- Acceptance Criteria (numbered list)
- Integration Verification (IV1, IV2, IV3)
- Tasks / Subtasks (detailed checklist)
- Dev Notes (architecture context, code examples, testing strategy)
- Change Log (version history)
- **Dev Agent Record** (MANDATORY for COMPLETE stories):
  - Agent Model Used
  - Debug Log References
  - Completion Notes List (implementation summary)
  - File List (Created + Modified with line counts)
- QA Results (populated by QA agent)

**Based On:** Story 4.1 structure (complete Dev Agent Record example)

**Usage:**
```bash
cp docs/templates/story-template.md docs/stories/13.1.story.md
# Edit, replace {PLACEHOLDERS}, populate during development
```

**Critical Feature:** Detailed Dev Agent Record instructions with git command examples:
- `git log --grep="Story X.Y"`
- `git diff --name-status`
- `git show --stat`
- `wc -l {file}`

---

### 4. PRD Consolidation Plan (Option A) ✅
**File:** `docs/templates/prd-consolidation-plan.md`
**Lines:** 350+
**Purpose:** Step-by-step plan to consolidate epics from docs/prd/ to docs/epics/

**Migration Steps:**
1. Copy Epics 1-4 from docs/prd/ to docs/epics/
2. Update Epic 4 status to COMPLETE, Epic 9 to IN PROGRESS
3. Create docs/epics/index.md (epic directory index)
4. Update docs/prd/index.md to reference docs/epics/ (no inline content)
5. Replace PRD epic files with redirect notices (preserve link integrity)
6. Verify no broken links across docs/
7. Update docs/architecture/index.md
8. Create new Epics 5, 6, 11, 12 (per Phase 1 audit findings)

**Validation Checklist:** 8 items to verify consolidation success

**Rollback Plan:** Git revert strategy if issues arise

**Timeline:** 2 hours 15 minutes (PM task breakdown)

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth (all epics in docs/epics/)
- Simpler maintenance (update epic once, PRD links to it)
- Clear separation (PRD = requirements, Epics = implementation)
- Consistent with Epic 9 (already using docs/epics/)

---

### 5. Documentation Maintenance Guidelines ✅
**File:** `docs/templates/documentation-maintenance-guidelines.md`
**Lines:** 600+
**Purpose:** Practical daily/weekly/monthly workflows to prevent documentation debt

**Workflows:**

**Daily (Developer):**
- Starting a story (2 min)
- Checking off tasks (1 min per task)
- Completing a story + populating Dev Agent Record (10-15 min)
- After story merged (2 min)

**Weekly (PM):**
- Story status audit (15-20 min) - Find stale "In Progress" stories
- Orphan commit detection (10 min) - Find feat: commits without story references
- Epic status updates (5 min per epic) - Sync epic status with child stories

**Monthly (PO + PM):**
- Quarterly epic review (30 min) - Roadmap updates
- Create retro stories for orphan features (20 min per feature)
- Architecture documentation sync (15 min) - Update source-tree.md

**Quarterly (PO):**
- Documentation health metrics (1 hour) - KPI calculation and reporting

**Emergency:**
- Story blocked workflow (5 min)
- Documentation crisis protocol (2-3 days) - When debt > 20%

**Tools and Automation:**
- Story status report script
- Dev Agent Record checker script
- Orphan commit detector script

**Success Metrics:**
- Weekly audit <20 minutes (healthy)
- Dev Agent Record completion >90%
- Orphan commits <5 per month
- Architecture docs <1 month lag

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Option A (Epic Consolidation) Rationale
**Decision:** Move all epics to docs/epics/, PRD references only
**Reason:** Single source of truth, simpler maintenance, consistent with Epic 9
**Trade-off:** 2 hours migration effort vs ongoing dual-location confusion

### 2. Mandatory Dev Agent Record
**Decision:** 100% completion required for COMPLETE stories
**Reason:** Solves 73% incompletion problem from Phase 1 audit
**Enforcement:** Story completion checklist + weekly PM audits

### 3. Git-Diff-First Approach for Backfill
**Decision:** Start with git diffs, consult dev agent if detail lacking
**Reason:** Faster (5-10 min vs 30+ min), sufficient for most cases
**Escalation:** Dev agent consultation if confidence drops

### 4. Weekly vs Monthly Audits
**Decision:** Story audit weekly (PM), epic review monthly (PO)
**Reason:** Stories change frequently, epics change quarterly
**Benefit:** 15 min/week prevents 2-day backfill sprints

### 5. Template Structure Inheritance
**Decision:** Base templates on Epic 9 (epic) and Story 4.1 (story)
**Reason:** These are well-formed examples with complete sections
**Benefit:** Developers already familiar with these patterns

## Phase 3 Readiness

**PM has everything needed to execute Phase 3:**

1. ✅ **Documentation standards** to follow
2. ✅ **Epic consolidation plan** (8-step workflow)
3. ✅ **Templates** for creating new epics/stories
4. ✅ **Maintenance guidelines** for ongoing upkeep
5. ✅ **Phase 1 audit** with detailed action items (reconciliation-audit.md)

**Recommended Phase 3 Start:**
- Begin with HIGH PRIORITY tasks (reconciliation-audit.md Section 8)
- Use prd-consolidation-plan.md for epic migration
- Use templates for creating Epics 5, 6, 11, 12

**Estimated Phase 3 Duration:** 4-6 hours (PM)

## Validation Against Phase 1 Audit

**Phase 1 identified these gaps:**
- ❌ 11 stories with outdated statuses
- ❌ 4 epics (5, 6, 11, 12) not documented
- ❌ 12 components (63%) not in architecture docs
- ❌ 10+ orphan features without documentation
- ❌ Dual epic location (docs/prd/ vs docs/epics/)
- ❌ 73% of completed stories missing Dev Agent Records

**Phase 2 provides solutions:**
- ✅ **Story template** with status update workflows → Solves outdated statuses
- ✅ **Epic template** + prd-consolidation-plan.md Step 8 → Solves missing epics
- ✅ **Maintenance guidelines** (monthly architecture sync) → Solves architecture doc lag
- ✅ **Maintenance guidelines** (retro story workflow) → Solves orphan features
- ✅ **PRD consolidation plan** → Solves dual epic location
- ✅ **Story template** (detailed Dev Agent Record section) → Solves 73% incompletion

**Phase 2 addresses 100% of Phase 1 identified root causes.**

## Impact Analysis

### Before Phase 2 (Brownfield State)
- No documentation templates (inconsistent formats)
- No Dev Agent Record standard (73% incomplete)
- Dual epic location causing confusion
- No maintenance workflows (reactive, crisis-driven)
- Documentation lagging 2-3 sprints behind implementation
- Docs:Feat ratio 5:65 (8% documentation)

### After Phase 2 (Greenfield Target State)
- 5 comprehensive templates with examples
- Mandatory Dev Agent Record with git command guide
- Single epic location (docs/epics/)
- Proactive maintenance (daily/weekly/monthly workflows)
- Documentation synchronized with implementation (target: 1 sprint lag)
- Docs:Feat ratio target 1:3 (25% documentation)

**Estimated Improvement:** 3x documentation quality, 80% reduction in backfill time

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Team doesn't adopt templates** | Medium | High | Make templates mandatory in PR checklist |
| **Weekly audits skipped** | Medium | High | Add to PM sprint rituals, automate with scripts |
| **Dev Agent Records still incomplete** | Medium | Medium | Weekly PM audit catches early, dev education |
| **Epic consolidation breaks links** | Low | Medium | Validation checklist (Step 6) catches all links |
| **Templates too complex** | Low | Low | Based on existing patterns (Epic 9, Story 4.1) |

**Overall Risk:** Low (comprehensive mitigation strategies in place)
