# Documentation Reconciliation Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Agent**: Sarah (Product Owner)
**Project**: Centaurus Drum Machine
**Audit Period**: Last 3 months (111 commits in last 2 weeks, 70+ feature commits in 3 months)

---

## Executive Summary

This audit compares implemented features (git commit history) against existing documentation (epics, stories, PRD, architecture docs) to identify brownfield documentation gaps and prepare for greenfield restructuring.

**Key Findings:**
- **35 story files** found in `docs/stories/`
- **1 epic** documented in `docs/epics/` (Epic 9)
- **4 epics** documented in `docs/prd/` (Epics 1-4)
- **70+ feature commits** in last 3 months (rapid development pace)
- **7 stories** have outdated statuses (marked "Draft"/"Planning" but implemented)
- **10+ orphan features** implemented without story/epic documentation
- **Source tree documentation** significantly outdated (12 undocumented components)

**Urgency**: Documentation is 2-3 sprints behind implementation. Without reconciliation, onboarding costs and tech debt will accelerate.

---

## 1. Implementation vs Documentation Gaps

### 1.1 Stories with Outdated Statuses

| Story ID | Current Status | Actual Status | Evidence | Priority |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **4.1** | Ready for Review | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `dbe6539`: "feat: implement Epic 4 Stories 4.1-4.7" | **HIGH** |
| **4.2** | In Progress | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `dbe6539`: Mass Epic 4 implementation | **HIGH** |
| **4.3** | Draft | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `dbe6539`: Mass Epic 4 implementation | **HIGH** |
| **4.4** | Draft | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `dbe6539`: Mass Epic 4 implementation | **HIGH** |
| **4.5** | Draft | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `dbe6539`: Mass Epic 4 implementation | **HIGH** |
| **4.6** | Draft | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `dbe6539`: Mass Epic 4 implementation | **HIGH** |
| **4.7** | Draft | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `dbe6539`: Mass Epic 4 implementation | **HIGH** |
| **5.1** | PLANNING | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `b0d9791`: "feat: implement Story 5.1 responsive architecture" | **HIGH** |
| **6.1** | BLOCKED | ⚠️ PHASE 0 COMPLETE | Commit `8ecffbf`: "feat: implement Story 6.1 Phase 0 - Unified WLED Device Manager" | **MEDIUM** |
| **9.1** | PLANNING | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `ebeba83`: "feat: implement Story 9.1 - Web MIDI Input Engine" | **HIGH** |
| **9.2** | PLANNING - Blocked by 9.1 | ✅ COMPLETE | Commit `58a0009`: "feat: implement Story 9.2 - Piano Roll Visualizer + LED Strip Output" | **HIGH** |

**Total**: 11 stories need status updates, 9 marked complete, 1 phase completion, 1 unblocked

### 1.2 Stories with Accurate Statuses (No Action Needed)

| Story ID | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **9.3** | READY FOR REVIEW - Implementation Complete | Commit `ae51ec0`: "feat: implement Story 9.3 - Guitar Fretboard Visualizer" |
| **11.1** | In Progress - Phase 2.1 Complete | Commit `d3a3d5f`: "feat: add LUMI scale/key sync to Piano Roll" |

---

## 2. Missing/Incomplete Epic Documentation

### 2.1 Epics Documented in PRD but NOT in `docs/epics/`

| Epic | PRD Location | Stories | Status | Action Required |
|------|--------------|---------|--------|------------------|
| **Epic 1: APC40 Hardware Controller** | `docs/prd/epic-1-apc40-hardware-controller-integration.md` | 1.1-1.6 | ⚠️ Partially Implemented | Copy to `docs/epics/`, update status |
| **Epic 2: Boomwhacker** | `docs/prd/epic-2-boomwhacker.md` | Unknown | ⚠️ Status Unknown | Copy to `docs/epics/`, verify implementation |
| **Epic 3: Multi-Controller Pro** | `docs/prd/epic-3-multi-controller-pro-monetization.md` | Unknown | ⚠️ Status Unknown | Copy to `docs/epics/`, verify implementation |
| **Epic 4: Global Music Controls** | `docs/prd/epic-4-global-music-controls.md` | 4.1-4.7 | ✅ COMPLETE | Copy to `docs/epics/`, mark COMPLETE |

**Finding**: The project uses TWO epic documentation locations:
- `docs/prd/` - Original epics (Epics 1-4)
- `docs/epics/` - Newer epics (Epic 9)

**Recommendation**: Consolidate all epics into `docs/epics/` for consistency. The PRD should reference epics, not contain them inline.

### 2.2 Epic 9 Status Mismatch

| Epic | Documented Status | Actual Status | Evidence |
|------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Epic 9: Multi-Instrument MIDI Visualization** | PLANNING | ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE | Stories 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 complete; Story 9.4 pending |

**Action**: Update `docs/epics/epic-9-multi-instrument-midi-visualization.md` status from "PLANNING" to "IN PROGRESS" (3 of 4 stories complete).

### 2.3 Undocumented Epics (Inferred from Git Commits)

Based on commit patterns, these feature families likely represent undocumented epics:

| Inferred Epic | Evidence Commits | Stories Found | Priority |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Epic 5: Universal Responsive Architecture** | `b0d9791`: Story 5.1 | 1 story (5.1) | **HIGH** - Create epic |
| **Epic 6: Multi-Client Sessions & WLED** | `8ecffbf`: Story 6.1 Phase 0 | 1 story (6.1) | **HIGH** - Create epic |
| **Epic 11: ROLI LUMI Integration** | `d3a3d5f`: LUMI scale/key sync | 1 story (11.1) | **MEDIUM** - Create epic |
| **Epic 12: Sound Engine Expansion** | `09c7088`: Acoustic guitar<br>`5ee68b9`: Rhodes piano<br>`50af26d`: FM bell | 0 stories | **MEDIUM** - Create epic + stories |

---

## 3. Orphan Features (Implemented without Story/Epic)

### 3.1 High-Impact Orphan Features

| Feature | Commit(s) | Impact | Documentation Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **ViewTemplate Component** | `fb6ffaf`: "feat: add ViewTemplate for consistent layouts" | **HIGH** - Architectural pattern used across views | Create story under Epic 4 or new Epic 13 (UI/UX Standards) |
| **APC40 Hardware Control** | `9bf1841`, `7cd31d6`, `0cd1296`, `2f0da19`, `1e45e42` | **HIGH** - Core hardware integration | Verify against Epic 1 stories, create missing stories |
| **Chord Generator** | `92cea51`: "feat: add chord generator to Guitar Fretboard" | **MEDIUM** - Feature enhancement | Create story under Epic 9 |
| **Beat Generator** | `ff1451e`: "feat: add beat generator with groove patterns" | **MEDIUM** - Feature enhancement | Create story (new epic or Epic 9) |
| **LED Strip Manager** | `8ecffbf`: Story 6.1 Phase 0 (documented in story but not epic) | **MEDIUM** - Hardware integration | Create Epic 6 |

### 3.2 Medium-Impact Orphan Features

| Feature | Commit | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Sound Engine Variants** | `09c7088`: Acoustic guitar<br>`5ee68b9`: Rhodes piano<br>`50af26d`: FM bell<br>`1b22d81`: 808 drums | Create Epic 12 + stories |
| **Autostart Scripts** | `f02fa59`: "feat: add autostart scripts" | Add to infrastructure docs |
| **Jam Session Legacy** | Component directory exists, no git commit found | Audit if deprecated, document if active |

### 3.3 Low-Impact Orphan Features (Documentation Optional)

- Color mapping improvements (`cc02eed`, `4b93b98`)

## 12. Conclusion

The Centaurus Drum Machine project has undergone rapid feature development (70+ features in 3 months, 111 commits in 2 weeks) with documentation lagging significantly behind implementation. This audit identifies:

- **11 stories** with outdated statuses needing immediate updates
- **4 epics** (5, 6, 11, 12) requiring creation or consolidation
- **12 components** (63%) not documented in architecture
- **10+ orphan features** implemented without story/epic documentation
- **Docs:Feat commit ratio of 5:65** indicating systematic documentation debt

**Immediate Action Required**: Execute Phase 3 HIGH PRIORITY tasks within 1 sprint to prevent further documentation drift. The recommended 4-phase reconciliation plan will establish greenfield documentation standards while preserving all implementation history.

**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 hours total across Phases 2-4 (PO + PM collaboration).

**Success Metric**: Achieve 100% story status accuracy, 100% epic documentation, and improve docs:feat commit ratio to 1:3.
