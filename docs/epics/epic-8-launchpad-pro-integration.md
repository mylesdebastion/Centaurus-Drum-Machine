## Stories

### Story 8.0: Hardware Controller Selection Infrastructure (PREREQUISITE)

**Title:** Refactor hardcoded APC40 controller to dynamic multi-controller selection system

**Brief Description:**
Transform the hardcoded `new APC40Controller()` instantiation in IsometricSequencer into a dynamic controller selection system using the existing HardwareManager abstraction. Creates a Controller Registry with factory pattern, React hook for controller switching, and UI dropdown for selection. Enables zero-modification integration for Launchpad Pro (Story 8.1) and future controllers (Epic 11: ROLI LUMI).

**Key Tasks:**
- Create `ControllerRegistry.ts` with factory pattern for all controller types
- Implement `useControllerSelection()` hook with localStorage persistence
- Build `HardwareControllerSelector.tsx` UI component (dropdown with connection status)
- Refactor `IsometricSequencer.tsx` to use HardwareManager instead of direct instantiation
- Add controller selector to IsometricSequencer settings panel
- Regression test APC40 functionality (verify no breaking changes)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Controller registry lists all controller types (APC40 available, Launchpad/ROLI disabled)
- ✅ Dropdown UI allows switching between controllers
- ✅ Selection persists across browser sessions (localStorage)
- ✅ IsometricSequencer uses HardwareManager abstraction (no direct `new APC40Controller()`)
- ✅ APC40 connects and functions identically to before refactoring (no regressions)
- ✅ Story 8.1 can add LaunchpadProController by setting `available: true` in registry

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-21
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Document:** [Story 8.0 - Hardware Controller Selection Infrastructure](../stories/8.0-hardware-controller-selection-infrastructure.md)

**✅ PREREQUISITE FULFILLED:** Story 8.0 completed successfully. LaunchpadProController can now be integrated by setting `available: true` in ControllerRegistry. Stories 8.1-8.3 are unblocked and ready for implementation.

### Story 8.1: LaunchpadProController Implementation

**Title:** Implement LaunchpadProController class with Web MIDI integration and RGB LED control

**Brief Description:**
Create the core `LaunchpadProController` TypeScript class that handles device connection, SysEx initialization (Mk3 and 2015 protocols), RGB LED control (velocity palette + RGB SysEx methods), and button input handling (velocity-sensitive pads + polyphonic aftertouch). Includes device detection, queue-based LED updates, and connection management.

**Key Tasks:**
- Implement device detection via Web MIDI API (identify Mk3 vs. 2015 models)
- SysEx initialization sequences for both hardware versions
- RGB LED control methods (velocity palette + RGB SysEx with 0-63 range)
- Button input event handling (Note On/Off, velocity, aftertouch)
- LED update queue with batching and throttling (16 LEDs per 5ms batch)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Connects to Launchpad Pro Mk3 and 2015 models
- Initializes device into Programmer Mode via correct SysEx
- Sets individual LED colors using RGB SysEx (0-63 per channel)
- Receives button press/release events with velocity values
- Queue processes LED updates without MIDI buffer overflow

### Story 8.2: Drum Sequencer Integration & Layout Orientation

**Title:** Integrate LaunchpadProController with drum sequencer and implement horizontal/vertical layout toggle

**Brief Description:**
Connect the new `LaunchpadProController` to the existing drum sequencer module, mapping the 8×8 grid to sequencer patterns (horizontal: 8 steps × 8 tracks, vertical: 8 pitches × 8 time steps). Implement color mapping utilities (spectrum/chromatic/harmonic modes adapted from APC40). Add layout orientation toggle controlled via top control button.

**Key Tasks:**
- Map 8×8 grid note numbers (0-119) to sequencer step positions
- Implement horizontal layout mapping (timeline left-to-right)
- Implement vertical layout mapping (timeline bottom-to-top)
- Adapt color mapping utilities (spectrum/chromatic/harmonic) to Launchpad RGB
- Create `LayoutManager` class for orientation switching
- Add button control for layout toggle (top row control button)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Drum sequencer patterns display correctly on 8×8 grid
- Note input from Launchpad pads updates sequencer patterns
- Velocity sensitivity controls note accent/brightness
- Horizontal layout maps correctly (columns = steps, rows = tracks)
- Vertical layout maps correctly (rows = pitches, columns = time)
- Layout toggle button switches orientation and refreshes grid LEDs
- Colors match intended spectrum/chromatic/harmonic modes

### Story 8.3: Performance Optimization & Multi-Device Testing

**Title:** Optimize LED update performance and validate cross-device compatibility (Mk3/2015/APC40)

**Brief Description:**
Benchmark LED update throughput, implement delta updates (only changed LEDs), and optimize batching strategy to achieve 60fps target. Test with both Launchpad Pro Mk3 and 2015 hardware to validate protocol compatibility. Ensure APC40 integration remains functional (regression testing). Create hardware integration documentation.

**Key Tasks:**
- Benchmark LED update rate (measure LEDs/second throughput)
- Implement delta update tracking (cache LED states, skip redundant updates)
- Optimize batch size and throttling interval (target: 1200+ LEDs/sec)
- Test with Launchpad Pro Mk3 hardware (SysEx `0x0E` protocol)
- Test with Launchpad Pro 2015 hardware (SysEx `0x10` protocol)
- Regression test APC40 functionality (ensure no breaking changes)
- Document hardware setup, troubleshooting, and browser compatibility

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Full grid updates (64 LEDs) achieve 60fps smoothness (no jitter)
- LED update throughput measured at 1200+ LEDs/second
- Delta updates reduce unnecessary MIDI messages by 50%+
- Launchpad Pro Mk3 initializes and operates correctly
- Launchpad Pro 2015 initializes and operates correctly (if available)
- APC40 functionality verified unchanged (existing tests pass)
- Hardware integration guide created in `/docs/hardware-integration/launchpad-pro.md`

- ✅ Layout orientation toggle uses existing button mapping pattern
- ✅ Color modes (spectrum/chromatic/harmonic) reuse APC40 implementation
- ✅ Consistent with existing component styling (Tailwind CSS)

### Performance Impact Minimal
- ✅ LED updates optimized with queue batching (no performance regression)
- ✅ Device detection runs only on connection (one-time overhead)
- ✅ Memory footprint similar to APC40 controller (LED state cache)
- ✅ No impact on audio/MIDI playback timing

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risk: RGB Color Conversion Errors

**Risk Description:**
Launchpad Pro uses **0-63 RGB range** (not standard 0-255). Incorrect conversion leads to saturated/wrong colors, degrading educational visualization quality.

**Mitigation:**
- Create `toLaunchpadRGB()` utility function with range clamping
- Unit tests for color conversion edge cases (0, 127, 255 inputs)
- Visual testing with known color palette from research findings
- Code review checklist includes RGB range verification

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation Effectiveness:** High

### Secondary Risk: Browser Compatibility Issues

**Risk Description:**
Web MIDI API not supported in Firefox (experimental flag required) or Safari (no support). Users may attempt to use unsupported browsers.

**Mitigation:**
- Feature detection with user-friendly error message
- Documentation explicitly recommends Chrome/Edge/Opera
- Graceful fallback UI explaining browser requirements
- Browser compatibility noted in README and setup guide

**Likelihood:** Low (most users use Chrome/Edge)
**Impact:** Low (alternative browsers readily available)
**Mitigation Effectiveness:** High

### Tertiary Risk: Device Detection with Multiple Launchpads

**Risk Description:**
User may have multiple Launchpad devices connected (Mk3 + Mini, etc.), causing ambiguous device selection.

**Mitigation:**
- Device selection dropdown UI (list all detected Launchpads)
- Auto-detect and prefer Launchpad Pro Mk3 over other models
- Save user's device preference to `localStorage`
- Clear visual feedback of which device is connected

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Low (user can manually select)
**Mitigation Effectiveness:** High

### Rollback Plan

**If integration causes issues:**

1. **Immediate Rollback (Code Level):**
   - Remove `LaunchpadProController` class from codebase
   - Remove Launchpad option from hardware selector UI
   - APC40 functionality remains unaffected (isolated implementation)
   - Revert via Git: `git revert <commit-hash>` (clean rollback)

2. **Partial Rollback (Feature Flag):**
   - Add `ENABLE_LAUNCHPAD_PRO` environment variable
   - Hide Launchpad option in UI when flag is false
   - Keep code in place for future debugging/fixes

3. **User Communication:**
   - Update documentation to note APC40 as recommended controller
   - Provide troubleshooting guide for users experiencing issues
   - Gather user feedback to prioritize bug fixes

**Rollback Feasibility:** HIGH (additive feature, no dependencies)
