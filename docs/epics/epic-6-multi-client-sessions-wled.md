# Epic 6: Multi-Client Sessions & WLED Integration

**Status:** üöß **IN PROGRESS** (Phase 0 Complete, Blocked by HTTPS‚ÜíHTTP Security)
**Priority:** High
**Target Completion:** Q1 2025 (Pending Capacitor native app decision)

---

## Epic Overview

This epic enables multiple users to join shared jam sessions where each musician controls their own WLED LED devices while sharing audio/MIDI/visualization data through a session server. The architecture follows a user-ownership model where each musician owns their instrument's LED controllers (guitar, drums, keys) and receives collaborative visualization data.

**Critical Blocker Discovered (2025-10-10):** Modern browsers block HTTPS websites from making HTTP requests to local devices (Mixed Content Security Restriction). This affects production deployment (`https://jam-dev.audiolux.app` ‚Üí `http://192.168.1.50` WLED device). Phase 0 (WLED Device Manager) is complete and works perfectly in development (`http://localhost:5173`), but cannot work in production without a native app approach (Capacitor).

**Vision:** Musicians jam together in shared sessions with their own WLED devices responding to both individual performance and the group's combined output, creating a cohesive visual experience across distributed hardware.

**Business Requirements:**
- Multi-user collaboration for remote/hybrid jam sessions
- Each user maintains independent control of their WLED hardware
- Real-time audio/MIDI data sharing with <100ms latency
- Consistent WLED device management UX across all experiments
- Reusable components to eliminate code duplication

**Technical Requirements:**
- Unified WLED Device Manager component (reusable across all experiments)
- Session server infrastructure (Socket.io for state/control, WebRTC for audio)
- User ownership model (no multi-client-to-one-WLED complexity)
- Responsive grid layouts for multi-device management
- Progressive disclosure UX for complex device settings
- **Production deployment requires Capacitor native app** (iOS/Android)

---

## Core Philosophy

### User Ownership Model

**Each musician owns their WLED device(s).** No multi-client-to-one-WLED coordination needed.

```
        Session Server (Socket.io/WebRTC)
              ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
         User 1     User 2     User 3
       (Browser)  (Browser)  (Browser)
            ‚Üì          ‚Üì          ‚Üì
      WLED Guitar  WLED Drums  WLED Keys
```

**Guitarist:** Owns WLED strips on guitar neck/body
**Drummer:** Owns WLED strips on drums/cymbals
**Keyboardist:** Owns WLED matrices behind keyboard

Each user's browser:
1. Captures audio from their instrument
2. Connects to session server (shares data)
3. Receives other users' audio/MIDI data
4. Generates combined visualization
5. Sends LED data to THEIR OWN WLED device(s)

### Unified Component Architecture

Single, reusable `WLEDDeviceManager` component used by:
- `/jam` (JamSession)
- `/dj-visualizer` (LiveAudioVisualizer)
- `/isometric` (IsometricSequencer)
- `/piano` (PianoRoll)
- `/session` (Multi-user sessions)

**Benefits:**
- Consistent UX across all experiments
- Reduced code duplication (replaces LEDMatrixManager, LEDStripManager)
- Single source of truth for WLED connection logic
- Easier maintenance and feature additions

### Progressive Disclosure for Complexity

**Essential controls visible:** Enable toggle, IP address, connection status, virtual LED preview
**Advanced settings collapsed:** LED count, orientation, test patterns, solo/mute
**Quick actions:** Test pattern, delete device

Reduces cognitive load on mobile while keeping power user features accessible.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKER: Mixed Content Security Restriction

### Problem

**All modern browsers block HTTPS websites from making HTTP requests to local devices.** This is a fundamental security restriction with NO workaround in web browsers.

```
‚úÖ Works: http://localhost:5173 ‚Üí http://192.168.1.50 (dev server, HTTP‚ÜíHTTP)
‚ùå Fails: https://jam-dev.audiolux.app ‚Üí http://192.168.1.50 (production, HTTPS‚ÜíHTTP)
```

**Browser error:**
> "Mixed Content: The page at 'https://...' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://192.168.1.50/...'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS."

**Additional restrictions:**
- **Chrome Private Network Access (PNA):** Chrome 130+ blocks public websites ‚Üí private network (192.168.x.x) requests unless WLED firmware sends `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true` header (not supported as of 2024)
- **iOS Safari Local Network Permission:** iOS 14+ requires system-level permission, still subject to mixed content blocking

### Solution: Native Mobile App (Capacitor)

**Recommended path forward:** Wrap React app as native iOS/Android app using Capacitor.

```
Current (Blocked):
https://jam-dev.audiolux.app ‚Üí ‚ùå ‚Üí http://192.168.1.50

Future (Unblocked):
Native iOS/Android App ‚Üí ‚úÖ ‚Üí http://192.168.1.50
```

**Why this works:**
- Native apps do NOT have mixed content restrictions
- Can freely make HTTP requests to local network devices
- Same React codebase (95% code reuse)
- Better UX for mobile users (app icon, notifications, Bluetooth MIDI)

**Implementation:**
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
npx cap init "Audiolux" "com.audiolux.app"
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

**Tradeoffs:**
- ‚úÖ Solves HTTPS‚ÜíHTTP blocker permanently
- ‚úÖ Native app features (Bluetooth, notifications, camera)
- ‚úÖ Better mobile UX
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires App Store / Google Play submission (review process)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users must install app (not instant web access)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Maintain both web (desktop) + native (mobile) builds

**Decision:** PARK multi-client session features (Phase 1-5) until ready for Capacitor native app development. Phase 0 (WLED Device Manager) complete and available for use in development environment.

## Technical Architecture

### WLED Device Manager API (Phase 0 - Complete)

```typescript
interface WLEDDeviceManagerProps {
  // Data (props-down pattern)
  ledData?: string[];                    // Hex color array ['FF0000', '00FF00', ...]

  // Layout (Story 5.1 pattern)
  layout?: 'mobile' | 'desktop';         // Controls responsive grid layout

  // Persistence (required)
  storageKey: string;                    // localStorage key (e.g., "wled-jam")

  // Optional configuration
  deviceType?: 'strip' | 'matrix' | 'auto';  // Default: 'auto'
  maxDevices?: number;                       // Limit devices (default: 10)
  showVirtualPreview?: boolean;              // Default: true
  compactMode?: boolean;                     // Minimal UI for embedded use
}

// Component internally:
// - Manages device list state
// - Maintains HTTP connections to each enabled device (fetch-based, not WebSocket)
// - Sends ledData to all enabled devices when it changes
// - Persists device configs to localStorage
```

**Example Integration:**
```typescript
// In LiveAudioVisualizer
const ledColors = useMemo(() => {
  return visualizationEngine.render(audioData);
}, [audioData]);

return (
  <WLEDDeviceManager
    ledData={ledColors}
    layout={isMobile ? 'mobile' : 'desktop'}
    storageKey="wled-dj-visualizer"
    deviceType="strip"
  />
