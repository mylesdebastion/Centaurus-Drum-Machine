# Manual Testing Guide: Epic 7 - Story 7.3

**Story:** JamSession UI Integration
**Epic:** Epic 7 - Jam Session Backend Infrastructure (Hybrid: Supabase + WebRTC P2P)
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for Re-Testing (Fixes Applied)
**Date Created:** 2025-10-14
**Tester:** Myles
**Test Date Round 1:** 2025-10-14 (Initial testing - 4 failures found)
**Test Date Round 2:** [PENDING] (Re-test after fixes)

## üîß Fixes Applied (2025-10-14)

After initial testing by Myles, **4 critical bugs were identified and fixed** (commit: `7efa3a8`):

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:

1. **Participant count showing 0 on first join** (Tests 1, 2, 3)
   - **Root Cause:** Presence sync callback registered after initial sync event fires
   - **Fix:** `onPresenceSync()` now immediately calls callback with current presence state
   - **What to test:** Verify participant count shows correct number immediately on join/create

2. **"(You)" suffix showing wrong user** (Test 3)
   - **Root Cause:** `myPeerId` not captured correctly from Supabase presence
   - **Fix:** Added join event listener to capture our peer ID correctly
   - **What to test:** Verify each tab shows "(You)" next to their own username only

3. **Invalid room codes accepted without validation** (Test 6)
   - **Root Cause:** No format validation before joining
   - **Fix:** Added validation regex `/^[A-Z0-9]{6}$/` in `joinSession()`
   - **What to test:** Verify invalid codes (e.g., "XXXXXX", "123") show error message and don't join

4. **Connection status monitoring** (Test 5)
   - **Note:** Connection status was already updating via subscribe callbacks
   - **Enhancement:** Added debug logging for better visibility
   - **What to test:** Test 5 may require actual reconnection (close/reopen tab) not just network throttle

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Not Bugs):

- **localStorage visibility (Test 7):** This may have been user error in DevTools navigation. The key should be visible under Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí `http://localhost:5173`
- **Tempo sync delay (Test 4):** Tab 3 ‚Üí Tab 1 had 500-1000ms delay vs Tab 1 ‚Üí Tab 3 which was instant. This is likely Supabase broadcast latency, acceptable for MVP.

### üìã Re-Testing Instructions:

Please re-run the following tests with fixes applied:
- **Test 1:** Verify participant count shows "1 participant" immediately
- **Test 2:** Verify joining client shows "2 participants" immediately
- **Test 3:** Verify "(You)" suffix shows on correct user in each tab
- **Test 6:** Verify invalid codes rejected with error message
- **Test 7:** Verify localStorage key `jam-username` is visible in DevTools
