---

## Friction Points Analyzed

### 1. New Work Breaks Existing Features

**Root Cause**: Integration brittleness from shared state without contracts

**Evidence**:
- 59 components spanning multiple domains (WLED, MIDI, Jam Sessions, Studio, Education)
- GlobalMusicContext modified by multiple features without versioned interfaces
- No integration tests or smoke tests to catch regressions
- Component coupling across feature boundaries

**Impact**: High - Every feature addition is high-risk

**Fixes Identified**:
1. Create interface stability layer (`src/types/api-contracts.ts`)
2. Add smoke tests (Playwright) for critical user paths
3. Implement feature flags for experimental features
4. Document public APIs between modules

---

### 2. UX/UI Inconsistencies Across Views

**Root Cause**: Manual enforcement of design standards without systematic checks

**Evidence**:
- Excellent UX_STANDARDS.md documentation exists
- 402 style references across 54 components
- ViewTemplate component created but underutilized
- Legacy components (JamSessionLegacy, AuthTest, LaunchpadProExperiment) use manual layouts
- Mix of component classes (`.btn-primary`) and inline Tailwind

**Impact**: Medium - Hurts polish but doesn't block functionality

**Fixes Identified**:
1. Create design system audit script
2. Migrate legacy views to ViewTemplate pattern
3. Extract reusable UI components (`src/components/UI/`)
4. Add UX compliance checklist to story template

---

### 3. Planning Takes Too Long / Too Much Human Oversight

**Root Cause**: Over-engineered BMad structure for solo dev scale

**Evidence**:
- Story 1.1: 260+ lines of documentation for single feature
- QA Results section: 130+ lines (overkill for manual testing)
- Enterprise-level processes without enterprise team

**Impact**: High - Planning overhead killing velocity

**Fixes Identified**:
1. Streamline story template (remove/collapse unused sections)
2. Use workflow automation (`*workflow brownfield-ui`)
3. Adopt "just-in-time" planning (1-2 stories ahead, not entire epics)
4. Simplify Dev Agent Record to key decisions only

---

### 4. No Automated Testing (Context: Small Solo Dev Project)

**Root Cause**: Rightfully avoiding enterprise test suite overhead

**Evidence**:
- Vitest framework installed but minimal test usage
- Manual testing approach documented in CLAUDE.md
- No smoke tests for critical paths
- No visual regression testing

**Impact**: Medium - Absence of smoke tests allows catastrophic breakages

**Fixes Identified**:
1. Create 5 Playwright smoke tests (not full suite!)
2. Add pre-deployment GitHub Action
3. Create manual testing checklist in docs/
4. Visual regression testing for key views

---

### 5. Documentation Cleanup Needed

**Root Cause**: Disconnect between dev completing tasks and updating docs/epics

**Evidence**:
- Epic registry shows completion but individual stories may lag
- No systematic "story completion checklist"
- Dev Agent Records incomplete in some stories

**Impact**: Low - Doesn't block development, hurts long-term maintainability

**Fixes Identified**:
1. Create "dev completes story" checklist
2. Add documentation update step to workflow
3. Periodic epic-to-story audit

---

### 6. Prioritizing What Features to Work On

**Root Cause**: Feature development without user feedback loop

**Evidence**:
- 5+ interactive modules built without usage analytics
- No feature usage tracking
- Building in vacuum without user validation
- Discord community exists but no data on user behavior

**Impact**: High - Building features nobody wants/uses

**Fixes Identified**:
1. Install Vercel Analytics (privacy-friendly)
2. Add feature usage tracking (which modules get opened?)
3. User acquisition before more features (100+ users target)
4. User interview program (Calendly + $20 gift cards)
5. Feature prioritization framework: Priority = (User Demand √ó Impact) / Dev Cost

---

### 7. Lack of Users to Test and Provide Feedback

**Root Cause**: Zero marketing/outreach + no SEO

**Evidence**:
- Discord invite exists (AnnouncementBanner)
- No analytics to measure user acquisition
- No systematic user testing program

**Impact**: High - Can't validate product-market fit

**Fixes Identified**:
1. User acquisition strategy (Reddit, Show HN, YouTube demos)
2. 1-on-1 user interview program
3. Beta tester recruitment
4. Community engagement (weekly feedback threads)

---

### 8. No Marketing/SEO Plans

**Root Cause**: Technical focus without growth strategy

**Evidence**:
- `index.html` has ZERO SEO optimization:
  - ‚ùå No meta description
  - ‚ùå No Open Graph tags (broken social shares)
  - ‚ùå No Twitter Card tags
  - ‚ùå Generic title "Audiolux Jam Session"
  - ‚ùå Using Vite default favicon
  - ‚ùå No sitemap.xml or robots.txt

**Impact**: Critical - Product is invisible to search engines

**Fixes Identified**:
1. Add comprehensive meta tags (30 min fix)
2. Create og-image.png and twitter-card.png
3. Install Vercel Analytics
4. Content marketing (blog posts, tutorial videos)
5. Community outreach (Reddit, Indie Hackers, Product Hunt)
6. Target SEO keywords: "online drum machine", "web midi controller", "browser-based DAW"

---

### 9. Monetization Features Not Ready (Early Community Concern)

**Root Cause**: Premature monetization planning

**Evidence**:
- Working on `monetize` branch
- No user base to monetize yet
- Risk of turning off early adopters

**Impact**: Medium - Timing risk

**Strategy Identified**:
1. **DON'T**: Launch paywalls before 100+ active users
2. **DO**: Soft-launch "Pro" features behind "Coming Soon" badges
3. **DO**: Survey early users on willingness to pay
4. **DO**: Offer "Founding Member" discount for early supporters
5. **Wait**: Build audience first, monetize second

---

### 10. Git Workflow Problems

**Root Cause**: No branch strategy or deployment safeguards

**Evidence**:
- 5 local branches with unclear purposes:
  - `main` (production - Vercel auto-deploy)
  - `dev` (staging - Vercel auto-deploy)
  - `monetize` (current branch - NO upstream tracking!)
  - `epic-16-wip`
  - `claude/*` (AI temp branches)
- Vercel auto-deploys BOTH main AND dev (risky!)
- No pre-push checks
- No branch protection
- Historical commits show manual build artifacts (`build(prod)`, `build(dev)`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed: dist/ now properly gitignored (commit c6e934b)

**Impact**: Critical - One bad push = production outage

**Fixes Identified**:
1. Create pre-push hook (prevent dist/ commits, force build check)
2. Document branch strategy in `docs/git-workflow.md`
3. Set upstream tracking for `monetize` branch
4. Add branch protection rules on GitHub
5. Clear workflow: feature ‚Üí dev (staging) ‚Üí main (production)

---

## Additional Weak Areas Identified

### 11. Feature Bloat Without Scope Management

**Evidence**:
- Started as "drum sequencer"
- Now: music production platform with 8+ feature domains
- 59 components without clear product focus

**Impact**: High - Dilutes development efforts

**Recommendation**: Define core product focus, move secondary features to "Labs" or "Experiments" section

---

### 12. State Management Coupling

**Evidence**:
- GlobalMusicContext is single point of failure
- Multiple features depend on shared context
- No versioned state contracts

**Impact**: High - Changes cascade unpredictably

**Recommendation**: Create typed API contracts, consider module-specific contexts

---

### 13. No Analytics/Telemetry

**Evidence**:
- Flying blind on user behavior
- Can't measure feature usage
- Can't identify drop-off points

**Impact**: High - Can't make data-driven decisions

**Recommendation**: Install Vercel Analytics or Plausible.io (privacy-friendly)
