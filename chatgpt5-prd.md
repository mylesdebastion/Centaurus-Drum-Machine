Product Requirements Document: Low-Latency ESP32 Jam Session Web App & Music Visualizer
by ChatGPT 5

This product is a low-latency, clock-synchronized web application for collaborative music jamming. It integrates with ESP32 microcontroller devices to support multi-user MIDI jam sessions and real-time music visualization. The system features a browser-based drum machine (4–8 tracks, 16-step sequencer) and a rich visualizer that maps musical notes and rhythms to colors. An educational mode is included to teach K-12 students rhythm and music concepts through interactive visual feedback. The app is designed browser-first (desktop & mobile web) and will evolve into native mobile apps in the future. No user accounts are required for basic jam sessions – users can join via simple room codes for an easy, inclusive experience.

Goals and Objectives

Real-Time Jam Sessions: Enable multiple users to perform music together over the internet with minimal latency and a shared master clock for synchronization
pcbway.com
. Each participant should stay in tempo sync regardless of network delays.

Multi-Channel MIDI Support: Support multi-channel/multi-instrument setups. A built-in drum machine provides 4–8 tracks for rhythm, and additional channels handle melodic or harmonic instruments. Live MIDI input (e.g. electronic instruments or MIDI controllers) is captured with velocity sensitivity to drive both sound and visuals.

Music Visualization: Provide engaging visuals in sync with the music. LED matrix integration (via WLED on ESP32) and on-screen animations will display beats and notes in real-time. Visual mappings translate musical pitch to color (with selectable modes: spectral, chromatic, harmonic) and velocity to brightness for intuitive feedback.

Educational Engagement: Make the system accessible and fun for kids (K-12). An education mode will introduce rhythm and melody concepts with age-appropriate prompts, using the visualizer to reinforce learning (e.g. showing how rhythmic patterns align with flashing lights, or how different notes correspond to different colors). Inspired by tools like Chrome Music Lab, the aim is to make learning music “more accessible through fun, hands-on experiments”
musiclab.chromeexperiments.com
.

Ease of Use & Accessibility: Require no sign-ups or complex setup for basic use. Users can create or join jam rooms with a autogenerated code or shared link – “No account needed. Just open the app and start playing.”
musiclab.chromeexperiments.com
 This lowers barriers for classroom use and spontaneous jam sessions. The UI will be intuitive for both novice and experienced users, with responsive design for tablets and phones.

Key Features
1. Synchronized Jam Session (Networking & Low Latency)

Global Clock Sync: A master clock (possibly hosted on a server or one participant’s ESP32 device) keeps all clients in tempo. All users’ sequencers and arpeggiators align to this clock so that downbeats occur simultaneously for everyone
pcbway.com
. This prevents drift and ensures tight coordination (e.g. if one person hits “start”, everyone starts on the next downbeat together).

Network Transport: Initially, MIDI note data and tempo info will be transmitted over the network (using WebSockets or WebRTC data channels) to minimize bandwidth and latency. Sending MIDI events (tiny messages) instead of raw audio allows the internet “to just send small loops/events back and forth”, keeping everyone in sync without heavy streaming
elektronauts.com
. Each client locally generates audio from the MIDI, reducing the impact of network delays.

Latency Mitigation: The app will quantify network latency and adjust as needed (e.g. slight scheduling offsets) so that events align in time. If real-time jamming over long distances proves too laggy, a fallback could buffer one measure ahead (as in asynchronous loop-based jams
elektronauts.com
), but the primary goal is real-time sync as much as possible. Techniques like Ableton Link (for LAN sync) may be integrated for local sessions, with possible future extensions for WAN synchronization
elektronauts.com
.

Room-based Collaboration: Users can start a session (room) which generates a unique code or URL. Others join by entering this code – no login required. The room session manages sync and data exchange between all participants. Rooms can be named for convenience and optionally protected by a passphrase. Once in a room, participants see each other’s contributions (e.g. the drum patterns or notes being played) and the shared visualizer.

2. Drum Machine & Sequencer Module

16-Step Sequencer: A classic 16-step grid is provided for programming beats (equivalent to a 4/4 measure divided into 16th notes)
gabrielyshay.medium.com
. Users can toggle steps on/off for each drum instrument track; a lit step indicates a hit on that beat. The sequencer plays in a loop, highlighting the current step position with a moving playhead (synchronized across all users and any connected LED displays).

Multi-Track Patterns: Support 4 to 8 parallel tracks (rows) in the drum machine, e.g. dedicated tracks for Kick, Snare, Hi-Hats, Claps, Toms, etc. This follows best practice as seen in 808-style drum machines where each sound has its own lane
learn.adafruit.com
. By default, a simple 4-track layout (Kick, Snare, Hat, Percussion) will be provided for ease of use, expandable up to 8 tracks for more complex rhythms.

Live Recording Mode: Users can tap out rhythms in real time (using keyboard keys, MIDI pad controller, or on-screen pads). The system will record these hits into the 16-step sequence with correct timing quantization. Velocity (how hard the pad is hit) is recorded too. This allows a more natural way to input patterns rather than clicking on grid squares. A metronome or count-in will be available to help users record on beat.

Velocity-Sensitive Playback: The drum sequencer supports velocity per step. Louder hits (higher velocity) result in louder sound and also brighter visual indicators. Each step in the UI may show intensity (e.g. varying bar height or color shade) to reflect velocity.

Sound and MIDI Output: By default, the drum machine uses built-in drum samples (e.g. a small set of classic TR-808 kit sounds) for quick demo and education. However, it also outputs standard MIDI so it can drive external sound modules or synths. General MIDI drum mapping is used for compatibility – e.g. channel 10 for drums, with note numbers 36 = Bass Drum, 38 = Snare, 42 = Closed Hi-Hat, etc as per the GM standard
music.stackexchange.com
music.stackexchange.com
. This ensures that if connected to external MIDI gear or software, the drum patterns trigger the expected sounds (kick, snare, etc. on their usual notes).

Pattern Management: Users can clear tracks, copy/paste patterns, and adjust basic settings like tempo (BPM) and swing/shuffle. The tempo is global to the session (controlled by the host or agreed source). Pattern length is fixed to 16 steps initially (4 beats of 4 subdivisions) to simplify sync; future versions might allow chaining patterns for longer sequences.

GM Best Practices: Following common DAW/Sequencer practice, the default drum kit layout and labeling will mirror typical assignments (e.g. Track1 = Kick, Track2 = Snare, Track3 = Hi-Hat, Track4 = Cymbal/Percussion) to make it intuitive. If an industry convention exists (like how General MIDI or certain drum machines label these tracks), we adhere to it for familiarity
music.stackexchange.com
.

3. Real-Time Visualizer (LED Matrix & On-Screen)

LED Matrix Integration: The system can connect to an ESP32 running WLED (or similar firmware) controlling an LED strip or matrix. The LED matrix will act as a large visual metronome and note display. For example, a 16x8 LED matrix could show a scrolling or pulsing pattern of the 16-step sequencer: a column of LEDs per step, advancing in sync with the beat, lighting up when a drum hits. The top row might flash to indicate the quarter-note pulse, etc. This “physical” visualizer helps turn sound into light, reinforcing rhythm understanding. (Initial integration may use WLED’s UDP or WebSocket APIs to send frame updates in sync with the music timeline.)

Color Mapping Modes: The visualizer will map musical notes to colors in a meaningful way. We will provide three modes:

Spectrum (Frequency) Mode: Maps the lowest pitches to red and the highest pitches to violet, with the intermediate notes spread across the visible spectrum (rainbow). This is ideal for broad-range rhythm or full mix visualization, as it treats pitch continuously – a low bass or kick drum will show as red, while a high treble note or cymbal might appear violet. It mirrors the idea of arranging notes by frequency similar to light frequency (red = low, violet = high).

Chromatic (Scale) Mode: Maps each of the 12 chromatic pitches to a repeating sequence of colors around the color wheel (e.g. C = red, C♯ = red-orange, D = orange, ... up through B = purple, then wrapping)
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. All octaves of the same note share the same hue. This is useful for single-melody instruments – it provides a consistent color identity for each note name, helping learners see patterns (for instance, a C major scale might always appear as a repeating color pattern).

Harmonic (Circle of Fifths) Mode: Assigns colors such that musically related notes have similar colors. For example, if C is red, its perfect fifth G is mapped to an adjacent hue like orange, and D (the next fifth) could be yellow, and so on around the circle of fifths yielding a rainbow progression
en.wikipedia.org
. In this scheme, harmonic relationships (like chords or keys) produce coherent color groupings. This mode is great for polyphonic instrument visuals – chords that are consonant will appear as harmonious color blends. (Notably, this approach was used by Scriabin in his color organ experiments – ordering notes by fifths yielded a spectrum order
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
.)

Velocity to Brightness: In all modes, brightness corresponds to velocity or intensity of the note. A softly played note produces a dim glow of its assigned color; a very strong accent produces a bright flash. This one-to-one mapping of dynamics to light intensity helps visualize the energy of the performance. For drums, this means ghost notes (soft hits) barely light up, whereas a accented beat lights the matrix boldly.

Visualization Examples: If a user records a drum beat, as it plays back, each drum hit triggers a burst of color on the LED matrix and the on-screen visualizer. For instance, the kick (a low-frequency sound) might always appear red (in Spectrum mode) at the moment it hits, while a snare (mid-range) might appear green. In chromatic mode, if the snare is tuned to an E note, it might always show as a certain color (say sky blue)
en.wikipedia.org
. The LED matrix can either display an abstract pattern or a literal “piano roll” style (e.g. lights moving left-to-right for time, and vertically positioned by pitch). Users will have options to choose the visualization style that suits the instrument: a spectrogram-like bar for drums versus a keyboard roll for melodic instruments.

User Controls for Visuals: Users can toggle which color mode is active globally or per instrument. However, sensible defaults apply: Rhythm tracks default to Spectrum mode (since drums often cover low to high frequencies, this gives an intuitive low vs high percussion visual); monophonic instruments default to Chromatic mode (to emphasize note identity); polyphonic instruments (like chord keyboards) default to Harmonic mode (to emphasize tonal relationships). These defaults align with typical usage (rhythm = full spectrum, single-note leads = distinct scale tones, harmonies = color-cohesive chords). Users interested in customization can override the mapping mode or even define custom color sets, but that’s an advanced feature.

WLED Performance Consideration: In early versions, visualizer focus may be on the browser (using WebGL or Canvas to render animations), with LED output as a secondary feature. As latency improvements are made, the goal is to have nearly instantaneous LED response to each note (e.g. using WLED’s real-time mode or DMX packets). We acknowledge that achieving perfect sync (audio, screen, and LED) is challenging; this will be continuously optimized in the later development phases.

4. Educational Mode (K-12 Focus)

Simplified Interface: When toggled into Education Mode, the UI will simplify and present guided exercises. Instead of a blank sequencer, it might show a pre-made simple beat or scale, along with prompts. Large, friendly buttons and graphics will cater to young users. For example, cartoon icons for drum sounds (bass drum, snare, etc.) can replace or accompany text labels, and an animated character or pointer might indicate the current beat.

Guided Rhythm Activities: The module will include mini-lessons like “Follow the Beat” – the app lights up a sequence on the LED matrix or screen and the student tries to clap or tap along, learning to keep time. Another exercise might be “Rhythm Copycat” where the app plays a short rhythm and the student programs that pattern into the drum machine by clicking the correct steps. Visual cues (flashing lights on the correct steps) will help them.

Color & Pitch Lessons: For melody, an exercise could highlight how pitch relates to color. For instance, the app might play a C major scale one note at a time; each note triggers a color on the screen/LED and the student hears the tone. A prompt explains “Notice how as the pitch goes up, the color moves through the rainbow.” This connects auditory frequency with the concept of a spectrum. Another lesson could show a simple chord and note how those notes’ colors are similar under the harmonic mode, explaining that those notes sound pleasant together (harmony). Age-appropriate language and analogies will be used (e.g. “low notes are red like a deep sunset, high notes are violet like a little flower, and notes that make a happy chord often share similar colors!”).

Interactive and Fun: The educational content will emphasize exploration. Students can toggle between visualization modes to see the difference (e.g. “What happens if we switch to Chromatic mode? All C notes turn red – can you find all the red notes on the song?”). The goal is to allow kids to discover concepts like octave equivalence or scales through play, not just lecture. We take inspiration from existing platforms – for example, Chrome Music Lab has shown the effectiveness of colorful, simple interfaces for teaching music basics in classrooms
musiclab.chromeexperiments.com
musiclab.chromeexperiments.com
. Our app should be teacher-friendly and engaging, potentially usable in a group setting with a large display or with each student on a tablet.

Curriculum and Documentation: We will develop a set of sample lesson plans or guide sheets for teachers. These might include tasks like “Make a beat with exactly 4 hits in it – try different patterns and watch the lights” or “Change the tempo and observe what happens to the flashing lights.” The educational mode will have an introductory tutorial that explains the interface in simple terms (e.g. “This is a drum. Every time the light goes here, the drum will play. Let’s make a drum beat!”). Over time, we can expand this mode with more content (for different grade levels, or integrating science of sound lessons).

5. MIDI and Hardware Integration

Web MIDI API Support: The web app will leverage the Web MIDI API
musiclab.chromeexperiments.com
 to connect to MIDI devices. This means users with a MIDI keyboard, pad controller, or electronic drum kit can plug it into their computer and use it to control the app. For example, hitting a pad on a MIDI drum controller can correspond to toggling a step or live-playing a drum sound. Similarly, the app can send MIDI out to devices – if a user has a hardware synth, the jam session’s MIDI notes for that synth track can be output so the hardware plays along. This two-way MIDI support makes the platform flexible for both virtual and physical instrument use.

ESP32 Peripheral Role: Each ESP32 (aside from running WLED for LEDs) could be programmed to serve as a MIDI-over-WiFi bridge or sensor input device. For instance, an ESP32 with buttons could act as a wireless pad controller: when the user hits those buttons, it sends note triggers into the session. The ESP32s will all sync to the master clock (they could subscribe to clock pulses over network or even derive from an NTP sync for <1ms accuracy). By using an ESP32 as a MIDI clock distributor (similar to UberClock’s approach of distributing a clock to multiple boxes
pcbway.com
), we ensure any locally connected devices stay on beat.

Optional Audio Input Sync: While not a core feature initially, the architecture will allow feeding live audio or external instrument signals for visualization. For example, a guitar’s audio could be fed to an Audio Reactive WLED setup (ESP32 with a mic or line-in) to make LEDs dance with music
kno.wled.ge
kno.wled.ge
. This is tangential to the MIDI jam focus but complements the visualizer goal.

WLED API Usage: The app will interface with WLED’s real-time APIs (HTTP, UDP, or WebSockets
kno.wled.ge
kno.wled.ge
) to send frame updates or color commands to LED strips. For synchronized multi-device setups, WLED’s UDP sync feature can clone patterns to multiple LED clients
kno.wled.ge
. We may also explore using the ESP32’s ability to subscribe to a centralized MQTT or similar for getting note events, which could reduce latency compared to polling. A later improvement might involve running a custom firmware on ESP32 (or a WLED usermod) specifically optimized for our use-case, but initially we’ll use standard WLED for convenience.

Modular Design: The system is built to accommodate varying hardware. If a user has no ESP32 at all, they still get full functionality in-browser (sound + on-screen visuals). If they have one or more ESP32 devices, they can add extra capabilities: e.g. one ESP32 driving an LED matrix visualizer, another acting as a MIDI input from a DIY button grid. We will document how to set up each piece. The ESP32 clock sync mechanism (likely using a network time protocol or a designated master device broadcasting a MIDI clock message) will be crucial to keep distributed hardware in lockstep with the web app. The target is to achieve a timing accuracy within a few milliseconds between lights and sound events, to truly give that in sync feel.

6. User Interface & Experience

Layout: The main web UI is divided into panels: (1) The Sequencer panel – shows the grid of steps for the drum machine and possibly piano-roll for melodic instruments. (2) The Visualizer panel – shows a live graphical representation of the music (could be an abstract wave, moving bars, or an emulation of the LED matrix). (3) The Control bar – includes play/stop controls, tempo, room code info, and mode switches (color mode, education mode toggle, etc.). This layout should be responsive: on wide screens, panels sit side by side; on narrow mobile screens, they may stack or toggle.

Joining & Onboarding: On first load, user sees a welcome screen with two choices: "Start a Jam" or "Join a Jam". Start a Jam generates a new session (and the app will provide the shareable code/URL). Join a Jam asks for a code. There may also be a list of recent or public jams if we allow that. Once in a session, the user is prompted to choose an instrument role (e.g. Drumkit, Bass, Lead, etc.) or multiple roles if they intend to control several tracks. This helps configure their UI (e.g. if someone selects “Drumkit”, they primarily see the drum machine; if they pick “Keyboard”, maybe a piano input interface is shown). However, by default, everyone can see and interact with all tracks unless restricted.

Visual Feedback: The UI uses color and motion to provide feedback. As the sequence plays, each step cell will light up according to the instrument’s color mapping when active. The current step is highlighted with a moving cursor bar. When a user plays a live note (say, presses a key for a synth sound), the note will briefly appear or flash in the sequence or visualizer so others can see it. Tooltips or small labels might show note names or velocities on hover.

Customization: Users can open a settings panel to tweak things: choosing a different drum kit sound set, toggling metronome click on/off, selecting a color theme for the UI (distinct from the music-visual colors, but for interface chrome), etc. An important customization is instrument color toggling – while the default mapping modes are as described, some users might want to assign a fixed color to a specific instrument for clarity in performance. We will allow, for instance, locking the kick drum’s color to something if desired (overriding the dynamic mapping, mainly for visual simplicity in some shows or if a user has color vision deficiency and needs certain contrasts).

Mobile Experience: On touch devices, the sequencer grid will be touch-friendly (large tappable squares). Scrolling or zooming may be needed if the screen is very small – possibly only part of the interface is visible at once. We plan to implement an adaptive UI: e.g. on a phone in portrait, show either the visualizer or the sequencer at a time with a swipe to switch, whereas on a tablet or desktop both can show together. The mobile app (phase 2/3 deliverable) will essentially wrap this web interface, with potential native optimizations for audio processing.

Error Handling & Guidance: Since no sign-in, sessions are ephemeral. The UI should handle cases like “connection lost” or “host left” gracefully (maybe electing a new host or pausing). In education mode, if the user does something “wrong” like off-beat tapping, the system won’t chastise but gently guide (“Let’s try that rhythm again with the metronome”). The design must be forgiving and encouraging to maintain user engagement, especially for children.

Functional Requirements

FR1: Session Management: The system shall allow creation of jam sessions and joining via room code or link. It shall manage synchronization data (tempo, clock, start/stop) for all members in a session. No user authentication is required for base functionality.

FR2: Real-Time Clock Sync: The system shall maintain a global metronome/clock with adjustable BPM. All event playback (sequencer steps, note on/off scheduling) must lock to this clock. The clock sync error between any two clients or devices should be minimal (target < 10ms). A “re-sync” mechanism shall be available to correct drift if detected (similar to UberClock’s restart to downbeat
pcbway.com
).

FR3: Multi-User Networking: The app shall broadcast MIDI events (notes, velocities, etc.) from each user to others in real-time. It should use a low-latency protocol (WebRTC DataChannel or WebSocket over UDP if possible). In case of network issues, the app may queue or drop events, but must attempt to keep the session in sync by the next downbeat.

FR4: Drum Machine Sequencer: The app shall provide 4–8 track step sequencers with 16 steps each (expandable later). Users can toggle steps on/off and the pattern will loop in sync. The sequencer must support per-step velocity. It should be possible to play/record the pattern live via tapping, with quantization to the step grid.

FR5: Sound Generation: The app shall produce audio for drum hits and instrument notes using Web Audio API (or an audio library like Tone.js
musiclab.chromeexperiments.com
). A default set of drum samples (at least kick, snare, closed hi-hat, open hi-hat, clap) must be included. For melodic instruments, basic waveform synths or sample presets can be included. Alternatively, integration with MIDI output to external synths shall be provided. Audio latency should be minimized (using Web Audio's scheduling to play exactly on beat).

FR6: MIDI Device I/O: The system shall support input from external MIDI controllers for playing/recording notes. It shall also send MIDI out, enabling use of external sound modules or DAWs. The MIDI implementation should adhere to standards (e.g. drum track on MIDI Channel 10 with GM drum note mapping by default
music.stackexchange.com
, unless user changes).

FR7: Visualization Engine: The app shall visualize incoming music data in real-time on an on-screen canvas. Visualization must update every beat or faster without significant lag (target frame latency < 50ms after a note event). It shall implement the three color mapping modes (Spectrum, Chromatic, Harmonic) as described, and allow switching between them. The brightness of each visual element must correspond to note velocity dynamically.

FR8: LED Matrix Integration: The system shall provide a way to connect to an ESP32-driven LED matrix or strip (running WLED or compatible). It should send synchronization and color data to the device. For example, via HTTP API calls or a persistent WebSocket/UDP stream. The LED updates should strive to synchronize with audio (within a few tens of milliseconds). Users should be able to configure the IP address of their WLED device and have the app drive patterns on it. If no external LED is configured, the system should still function fully using just on-screen visuals.

FR9: Educational Mode Content: When in education mode, the system shall present predefined lessons or challenges. It should have at least a few guided tutorials (with steps/hints) teaching a basic beat and a basic melody. Visual elements (text bubbles, arrows, animations) should lead the user through these lessons. This mode should be togglable, and when off, the full-featured “free jam” mode is active.

FR10: Cross-Platform UI: The web interface must be usable on common browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on desktop and mobile. Responsive design is required to adjust layout for smaller screens. All interactive elements (buttons, sequence steps) must be touch-friendly. Performance on a mid-range mobile device should still allow a couple of users and at least the drum machine with minimal lag.

FR11: No-Account Workflow: Users shall not be forced to register. All session data is transient (though an optional account system might be added later for saving presets or recordings – that is out of initial scope). Upon creating a session, a random room ID or code is generated. The host can share this code to invite others. The system may implement simple safeguards (like a room password or consent for joining) to avoid trolls, but by default it’s quick and easy to start.

FR12: Content Persistence: Within a session, any user’s actions (placing a drum hit, playing a note) are reflected for all. If a new user joins an ongoing jam, they should receive the current state (e.g. the current patterns and settings) upon entry so they sync up. However, once the session ends (everyone leaves or host closes), the data can be discarded (unless a save/export feature is used, which could be a later enhancement).

FR13: Sample & Sound Management: The drum module shall have a few built-in sound packs (e.g. “808 kit”, “acoustic kit”). Users can switch drum sounds per track (e.g. change the snare to a different sample) for variety. Also, for melodic instruments, a small selection of timbres (sine wave, piano, etc.) should be available. The system should allow expansion (like uploading a custom sample for a drum track) but this might come later.

FR14: Scalability of Participants: The architecture should support multiple users in one session (goal: at least 4-6 users jamming concurrently, as a starting point). This includes managing network message distribution (possibly using a server as a hub or P2P connections). The UI should identify each user’s contributions (maybe color-code or label events with user name) so it’s clear who is playing what.

Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: Low Latency – The end-to-end latency for a local user’s action to reflect in their audio and visuals should be imperceptible (ideally < 20ms). For remote users, the goal is to keep latency low enough that playing in time is feasible (target < 50ms one-way latency for within-region participants). Techniques like client-side prediction or quantizing events to the nearest 1/16th note boundary will mask latency by ensuring everyone lands on the same beat even if network delays slightly. In worst case, if true real-time sync isn’t possible, the system should degrade gracefully (e.g. switch to the “small loop exchange” method
elektronauts.com
, where each bar is delayed by one bar to others, preserving musical alignment at the cost of immediacy).

NFR2: Timing Precision – The sequencer timing should be rock solid. Use high-precision timers for scheduling in the browser (Web Audio clock or performance.now) and avoid drift. ESP32 devices should utilize hardware timers or external sync pulses to stay phase-aligned. The system should periodically re-align on bar boundaries to correct any minor drift among clients. The expected precision is within a few milliseconds over minutes of play.

NFR3: Reliability – The web app must handle temporary network interruptions. If a user’s connection lags, the app should attempt to catch them up rather than stall the whole jam. The system could mute or ghost a user who’s badly out of sync to preserve overall session quality, with an option for them to re-sync. All state changes should be atomic and conflict-managed (if two users try to edit the same drum track simultaneously, there should be a clear rule or last-write-wins behavior).

NFR4: Compatibility – Use widely supported web technologies (e.g. Web Audio API, WebMIDI which is supported in Chrome/Edge; Safari may need polyfill or alternative). For mobile, since WebMIDI might not be available on iOS Safari, ensure the app still functions (possibly limit to on-screen controls for iOS). The ESP32 side should use standard protocols (HTTP/MQTT/UDP) so that even alternative firmware or devices could integrate in the future.

NFR5: Security and Privacy – Even though no login is required, basic security is needed. All network traffic should be encrypted (wss or webrtc). Room codes should be sufficiently random to prevent unauthorized guessing. If we allow public jams, clearly mark them; otherwise sessions are by invite. No sensitive personal data is stored. If a teacher uses this in class, they should have control (e.g. ability to remove a participant if an outsider somehow joins). Content-wise, it's just music data, but we should protect against any injection (validate MIDI messages, etc. to avoid someone sending malformed data that crashes another client).

NFR6: Maintainability & Extensibility – The codebase should be modular: e.g. the visualizer should be able to accept new mapping modes or support different LED configurations (strip vs matrix) without rewriting core logic. The sequencer should allow different step lengths (future expansion to 32-step patterns or different time signatures). Also prepare for phase 2 features like recording the jam (saving sequence or even recording audio output), user profiles for saving preferences, and the native mobile app conversion.

NFR7: Performance at Scale – If multiple sessions run on a server, ensure the backend (if any) can scale. Alternatively, a peer-to-peer approach via WebRTC can offload server bandwidth. But a central signaling or relay server must handle possibly many concurrent rooms, so it should be lightweight. The design target is perhaps dozens of simultaneous sessions (for a start, given this is a niche app) but capable of growing if interest spikes (cloud-deployable). Each session’s data rate is relatively small (MIDI events and occasional sync messages), which is network-efficient compared to audio streaming.

NFR8: User Satisfaction & Testing – Particularly for the educational use-case, the tool should be thoroughly tested with actual students and educators to ensure it's understandable. The UI text, icons, and color choices should account for accessibility (e.g. color-blind friendly mode if needed, or the ability to distinguish elements by shape as well as color). Sound levels of samples should be normalized to avoid any jarring loudness changes. The app should be fun – ideally, young users stay engaged (we might measure this by retention in a pilot classroom trial). For musicians, the measure of satisfaction is whether they can successfully jam and feel “in the groove” despite being remote.

Development Phases and Future Enhancements

Phase 1: Core Jam & Visualization – Focus on implementing the core jam session functionality in the browser: multi-user sync, the drum machine, basic visualizer on-screen, and simple WLED integration. Ensure low latency on local network and acceptable latency over internet for 2-3 users. Include the basic color modes and default sound kit. Basic UI for room creation and joining without accounts. Deliver the fundamental educational mode with a couple of example lessons. This phase delivers the MVP for use in controlled settings (e.g. a classroom with all devices on same LAN, or remote jam with slight limitations).

Phase 2: Enhanced Hardware Sync & Mobile – Improve the ESP32 integration: possibly implement a dedicated sync firmware or use protocols like Ableton Link adapted for internet. Work on reducing latency further, maybe using techniques like forward prediction or local tempo adjustment if lag detected. Also, expand WLED support to advanced patterns (e.g. 2D LED matrices, different geometries). Begin development of native mobile apps or PWA enhancements for better performance on iOS/Android (including solving background audio issues on mobile browsers, etc.). Introduce more content in the educational module (additional lessons, maybe an interactive game format).

Phase 3: Full Feature Maturity – Add user account system (optional) to allow saving of sessions, user preferences, or recording/sharing jams. Introduce more instrument types (bassline sequencer, chord pads, etc.) and possibly integrate cloud synthesizers or services for richer sound. Implement jam session recording/replay – e.g. capture the MIDI and allow playback or editing after the live session. Possibly incorporate video or chat for communication between users (nice-to-have). Also, refine the UI/UX based on user feedback – e.g. better visualization modes, support for custom note-to-color mappings (for synesthetes or creative use). Ensure the platform can be used not just for education but also by hobbyist musicians and even live-streaming collaborative performances.

Throughout all phases, the project will adhere to best practices in music tech: using standard MIDI mappings
music.stackexchange.com
, respecting how drummers and producers expect drum machines to behave, and incorporating community feedback from educators and musicians alike. The end vision is a platform where anyone can hop into a jam with friends across the world, make some beats, see their music come alive in color, and learn a bit along the way – all in perfect sync.
