## Hardware Controller Requirements

### Supported Browsers

| Browser | MIDI Support | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Chrome** | ✅ Full | Recommended - Complete Web MIDI API support |
| **Edge** | ✅ Full | Complete Web MIDI API support |
| **Firefox** | ⚠️ Basic | Limited SysEx support, basic MIDI functionality |
| **Safari** | ❌ None | Web MIDI API not supported |

### HTTPS Requirement

**⚠️ Important**: Hardware controllers require **HTTPS** or **localhost** to function due to Web MIDI API security requirements.

- ✅ **Production**: Must use HTTPS (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
- ✅ **Development**: `localhost` is considered secure (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
- ❌ **HTTP**: Regular HTTP connections will not work with MIDI devices

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser (Chrome/Edge recommended for full features)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/centaurus-drum-machine.git
cd centaurus-drum-machine

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The development server will start on `http://localhost:5173` (HTTPS not required for localhost).

### HTTPS Development Setup

If you need to test HTTPS-specific functionality or connect from other devices:

#### Option 1: Local HTTPS with Vite

```bash
# Install local certificates (one-time setup)
npm install -D @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl

# Update vite.config.ts to include HTTPS
# See "HTTPS Configuration" section below
```

#### Option 2: Using mkcert (Recommended)

```bash
# Install mkcert
# macOS
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install mkcert

# Linux
# See: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation

# Create local CA and certificates
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

# Update Vite configuration to use certificates
```

#### Option 3: Using ngrok (For external testing)

```bash
# Install ngrok globally
npm install -g ngrok

# Start your development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, create HTTPS tunnel
ngrok http 5173
```

### HTTPS Configuration

Add HTTPS support to your `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import fs from 'fs'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    https: {
      key: fs.readFileSync('localhost-key.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('localhost.pem'),
    },
    port: 5173,
    host: '0.0.0.0', // Allow external connections
  }
})
```

## Hardware Controller Setup

### Connecting Your MIDI Device

1. **Connect your MIDI controller** via USB or MIDI cable
2. **Open the application** in a supported browser
3. **Check the hardware status indicator** in the top-right corner
4. **If connection fails**, see troubleshooting section below

### Supported Controllers

The application uses a generic MIDI interface that works with most controllers:

- **Akai APC40/APC40 MkII** - Optimized support with LED feedback
- **Novation Launchpad series** - Grid controllers
- **Arturia BeatStep** - Step sequencers
- **Most MIDI keyboards** - Basic note input
- **Generic MIDI controllers** - CC and note input

## Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run test:ui      # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

## Troubleshooting

### MIDI Connection Issues

#### "Hardware Not Supported" Message

**Cause**: Your browser doesn't support Web MIDI API

**Solutions**:
- Switch to Chrome or Edge for full hardware support
- Firefox has basic MIDI support with limitations
- Safari users can still use all software features

#### "HTTPS Required" Message

**Cause**: Web MIDI API requires a secure context

**Solutions**:
1. **Development**: Use `localhost` (already secure)
2. **Production**: Deploy to HTTPS site
3. **Local Network**: Use mkcert or ngrok (see HTTPS setup above)

#### "No MIDI Devices Available" Message

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. **Check physical connection**: Ensure device is connected via USB
2. **Verify device power**: Some controllers need external power
3. **Test device recognition**:
   - Windows: Check Device Manager
   - macOS: Check Audio MIDI Setup
   - Linux: Check `lsusb` output
4. **Try different USB port**: Some ports may have power/data limitations
5. **Restart browser**: Refresh MIDI device list
6. **Check device compatibility**: Ensure device supports USB MIDI

#### Connection Drops Unexpectedly

**Common Causes**:
- USB cable connection issues
- Device power management settings
- Browser background tab limitations

**Solutions**:
1. Use a high-quality USB cable
2. Disable USB power saving in system settings
3. Keep browser tab active and visible

### Browser-Specific Issues

#### Chrome/Edge
- Usually no issues
- Full Web MIDI API support
- Best performance and compatibility

#### Firefox
- Limited SysEx support
- Some advanced features may not work
- Basic MIDI input/output functional

#### Safari
- No Web MIDI API support
- Software-only mode available
- Consider using Chrome or Edge for hardware features

### Performance Issues

#### High CPU Usage
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Reduce audio quality if needed
- Check for background processes

#### Audio Latency
- Use ASIO drivers on Windows
- Reduce buffer sizes in audio settings
- Close other audio applications

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Audio Engine**: Tone.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **MIDI**: Native Web MIDI API
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
